    First of all I want to say great blog! I had a quick question that I'd like to ask if 
you do not mind. I was curioujs to fid oout how you center yourself and clear yor thoughts prior to writing.
I hve had trouble clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out there.
I truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are sually wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any recommendations or 
tips? Kudos!
