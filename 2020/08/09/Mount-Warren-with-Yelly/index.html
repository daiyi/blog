<p>Hi I’m Mica, I am a dog.</p>
<p>Just me and my BFF <a href="https://ayeletbitton.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yelly</a> went together for a Sunday stroll up a peak: Mount Warren, 12,332 ft. Having started up the mountain and turned around 4 years ago because it was so boring, Yelly warned me that it would be a boring day. But if there’s anything a dog is good at, it is finding a way to not be bored.</p>

</a></p>
<p>When Yelly got into the adventure truck that morning I jumped right into the copilot seat, because I know this machine to be a magical portal to interesting places. We headed towards Tuolumne but stopped before we got there. I have <em>still</em> never been to Yosemite, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/pets.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wonder why no one will bring me</a>?</p>

<p>There were plenty of trees at the start of the hike for squirrels to live in, I kept my nose peeled for juicy rodents. Yelly called me a lot in the beginning, but after a while we relaxed into a routine of me going out to scout and Yelly reliably following my lead.</p>
<p>We passed through some delicious mountain water streams. Yelly kept splashing me!</p>

<p>Soon the tall grass came to an end and we entered the talus zone.</p>
<p><img src="talus-boundary.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Yelly stopped us for breaks occasionally, like humans tend to do. Dogs don’t really take breaks, but I would occasionally keep her company (especially since it meant I would recieve food).</p>
<div class="photo-small">
<p><img src="take-a-break.jpg" alt=""></p>
</div>
<p>The talus field seemed to go forever into the distance, perhaps the entire mountain was a pile of talus. The sun was hot, and Yelly offered me a lot of water, even when I wasn’t thirsty. When I didn’t drink, she dumped the water on my back!</p>

<p>Finally the talus gully brought us to a delightful detour: snow! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermelon_snow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watermelon flavoured</a> this time. I love snow, it is the ideal playground to dig and wriggle in with little consequence, although I have basically an infinite pain tolerance anyway.</p>

<p>I would be happy to play in the snow all day, but we had to continue to the summit. I found the register! This is my third <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Peaks_Section#SPS_List" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPS</a>. There was a big view of Mono Lake below, and Yosemite which I can look at but not walk on(?)</p>

<p>We relaxed at the summit as Yelly ate snacks and video called Leo, and I checked out the solar-paneled weather station that had seen better days.</p>

<p>The clouds rolled in for our descent, and Yelly finally stopped splashing me with water. I ran ahead but checked back occasionally to see that she was still following me. That was a great day!</p>
