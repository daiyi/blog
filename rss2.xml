      <content:encoded><![CDATA[  <figure>      <img src="sunrise-boulder.jpg" alt="Sunrise Boulder, with a view of Tenaya Peak">      <figcaption>      Sunrise Boulder, with a view of Tenaya Peak      </figcaption>  </figure><p>The masses have shockingly failed to notice the summer bouldering in Tuolumne. The subalpine pebbles retain their solitude despite being attached to the top-mobbed National Park of the country (Yosemite). The rock is textured Eastern Sierra granite with plentiful crystals and improbable knobs. There’s overhanging 3D route shapes and unique movement, often like stacked pancakes toppled over in various orientations. With the seasonal appearances of alpine wildflowers, grasses, and mushrooms, it’s a fairy hallow. Then you jump into the big cold lake after a session. I ran into maybe 3 other parties this past season. It’s so easy to wild camp in the East side compared to the Valley. It’s just an hour drive from where I lived in Mammoth. So good!</p>  <figure>      <img src="summertime.jpg" alt="Views of Tenaya Peak from Summertime Boulder <3" class="small">      <figcaption>      Views of Tenaya Peak from Summertime Boulder <3      </figcaption>  </figure><p>I find the easy range to be pretty underdeveloped, though you can often play around on unnamed and undocumented v0-1 in the vicinity of the classics. I also found v3 and below to be sparse (or height-dependent, or super scary), but the v4-5 zone was very engaging for me! and plenty of v6-9 for my friends to play on. Fun for the whole family. Here’s my season roundup:</p><h3 id="Tuolumne-v5-6"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Tuolumne-v5-6">&gt;</a>Tuolumne v5-6</h3><ul><li>Kauk problem v5 (The Knobs). this is the send that led me to finally believe I can climb v5. powerful, crimpy, precise moves (I guess this is my style??)</li></ul><p><em>For next time:</em></p><ul><li>Cellulite Eliminator stand v5 (The Gunks) - need to refine my left heel hook!</li><li>Black matter v6 (Tenaya Lake Boulders) - so powerful so sharp! gotta go back with more pads. I do love a crimp. Looks like it’s been downgraded to v5 on the Proj.</li><li>Unnamed v5 next to Detached (Medlicott Boulder) - it’s the sit start to the unnamed v4</li></ul>  <figure>      <img src="medlicott-approach.jpg" alt="Wandering between Medlicott boulders.

Sunrise boulder is a lone, massive boulder on a massive slab, with all-time views of Tenaya and Cloudsrest. Great hang.</li><li>Short Train v4 (Pywiak Boulder) - start horizontal and escape from a chilly creekside cave. very workable, kind of enduro. nice to have a couple pads for the talus-y landing. fun!</li></ul>  <figure>      <img src="short-train.jpg" alt="Pulling out of the streamside cave on Short Train v4 - Pywiak Boulder" class="small">      <figcaption>      Pulling out of the streamside cave on Short Train v4 - Pywiak Boulder      </figcaption>  </figure><ul><li>Summer Vacation v4 (Summertime Boulder) - it’s a hike, and difficult to find, but the climb has unique granite features in a scenic location. another tuolumne escape-the-cave triller. Directions: Turn left (uphill) off the lake trail at (37.83242, -119.45311). Boulder is at (37.82888, -119.45279)</li></ul>  <figure>      <img src="summer-vacation-v4.jpg" alt="Summer Vacation v4 on Summertime boulder" class="small">      <figcaption>      Summer Vacation v4 on Summertime boulder      </figcaption>  </figure><ul><li>Knobs Creek v4 (The Knobs) - tall but straightfoward, for vertical crimping enthusiasts</li><li>Spaceballs v4 (Raisin Creek) - tough!!! the tension required for shorter-spanned people is incredible. proud v4 for me. Location: (37.82868, -119.47559)</li><li>Slopers and Dopers v4 (Drug Dome Trees) - another route with cool movement for granite</li><li>Unnamed v4 next to Detached (Medlicott Boulder)  - crimpy, technical sequencing and footwork, a bit overhanging, playing with body tension, funky visual feature. love it!</li></ul>  <figure>      <img src="detached.png" alt="Unnamed v4 on Medlicott boulder" class="small">      <figcaption>      Unnamed v4 on Medlicott boulder      </figcaption>  </figure><ul><li>Unnamed v4 (Arena Boulder backside)  - overhanging lowball transitions into surprising mantle topout! more harder (tall) stuff on this boulder, including the ominous Buttermilks Simulator.</li></ul>  <figure>      <img src="arena.jpg" alt="Under the v4 and v6 of the backside of Arena boulder (you can see the car parked by the road)" class="small">      <figcaption>      Under the v4 and v6 of the backside of Arena boulder (you can see the car parked by the road)      </figcaption>  </figure><p><em>For next time:</em></p><ul><li>Cave route v4 (Olmsted Canyon)  - very cool big moves between crimps under the roof felt SO hard. there’s a wild mantle move at the top as a treat</li></ul>  <figure>      <img src="cave-route.jpg" alt="Not your typical topout mantle on Cave Route v4" class="small">      <figcaption>      Not your typical topout mantle on Cave Route v4      </figcaption>  </figure><h3 id="Tuolumne-v3"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Tuolumne-v3">&gt;</a>Tuolumne v3</h3><ul><li>Medlicott warmup boulder unnamed v3 - fun big movements! 1 min south of Medlicott boulder, location: (37.86200, -119.42924)</li><li>Unnamed v3 at Pywiak Boulder - The finish to Short Train</li><li>Sunshine stand v3 (Sunrise boulder)</li><li>Solar eclipse v3 (Sunrise boulder) - both worthwhile and at a super pretty location</li></ul><p><em>For next time:</em></p><ul><li>double dyno v3 - the dyno feels super sandbagged if you’re shorter</li><li>leap of faith v3 - just feels impossibly tall at the top</li><li>Machine World v3 - I kept meaning to come out here to work long traverse on a solo day, but I was busy all summer. 2 min approach and looks super fun.</li></ul><h3 id="Tuolumne-v2"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Tuolumne-v2">&gt;</a>Tuolumne v2</h3><p>In the classic Eastern Sierra style, there is no shortage of extremely sandbagged, harrowing v2’s. Standouts for me:</p><ul><li>Dark Helmet v2 - work checking out if you’re at Spaceballs, warning about the spicy topout!</li><li>v2 on Sunrise Boulder - I actually thought this was pretty fun, managed to do a ridiculous hand-foot match piano</li></ul><h3 id="Tuolumne-v0-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Tuolumne-v0-1">&gt;</a>Tuolumne v0-1</h3><p>Carefully read the descriptions in the book because many of the 0s and 1s listed are actually super scary slabs and not necessarily beginner friendly! Areas to play around it:</p><ul><li>The Knobs - People love to pull on knobs, fun for the whole family. Many v0s and v1’s that are fairly vertical.</li><li>Puppy Dome - mostly scary slab highballs but you can find lines self-discovery style. and bail to swim in the river if you’re over the sandbagged routes!</li></ul><p>After writing this all out and rifling through the photos, I am so so so homesick for summer, missing the carefree days and the merry crew. It’s also a celebration of the friends I made this year who stuck with me through snow, heat, t-storm, bushwhacking, injuries, loneliness, and getting super sick. The Eastern Sierra will always be home and I know I will be back. &lt;3</p>  <figure>      <img src="dura-mater-slab.jpg" alt="Bravely climbing the v4 slab without pants protection! on Dura Mater boulder (behind Summertime Boulder)">      <figcaption>      Bravely climbing the v4 slab without pants protection! on Dura Mater boulder (behind Summertime Boulder)      </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="car-tesselation.jpg" alt="The summer of tessellating crash pads and friends into cars" class="small">      <figcaption>      The summer of tessellating crash pads and friends into cars      </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="olmsted.jpg" alt="Someone forgot to pack jackets and had to use the car dog blanket!

The timing depends on the snow pack, but I’d count on July or August being the most intense. most areas that aren’t under moist trees don’t get that bad, but definitely bring bug spray (or permethrin-treated clothing if you want to swim without getting bug spray into the super clean waters).</li><li>You kind of need the book (or a friend with the book), because even with all its inaccuracies (I’ve taken a sharpie to some of the gps points in my housemate’s copy out of frustration), Mountain Project is very incomplete for this area (maybe related to its relative obscurity?)</li><li>There’s water (and bathrooms) at the JMT station</li><li>not much cell signal in Tuolumne, download your offline maps and beta ahead of time. Make a meetup plan and a backup meetup plan.</li><li>The Tuolumne general store is open seasonally, don’t depend on it for food (especially spring and fall)</li><li>There’s sometimes live music at the Mobile in the summer (Saturday?)</li><li>If your fingers cry for mercy, there’s a great swimming spot on the river by Puppy Dome Boulders. Tenaya Lake is a classic of course. There’s some waterslides around Tuolumne, go look for them (wear shorts though LOL)</li><li>The Tuolumne campgrounds have been closed for renovations for a few years :/ Anyway those suckers need to be reserved like 6 months in advanced</li><li>There’s walk-in car camping outside the east gate/just past Tioga pass on the 120</li><li>Put your food in the bear boxes (if there’s any at the parking spot) or lock your van. Bears will actually break in (they’re pros at door handles) and smash open your van fridge</li><li>The bustability of sleeping in your van inside the park is high, I wouldn’t count on it</li><li>Thunderstorms tend to happen in the afternoon, so you can often get a morning session in (just don’t forget to keep track of both sides of the sky)</li><li><a href="http://weather.gov">weather.gov</a> is your most reliable weather source</li><li>If the mushroom has gills, probably don’t eat it</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

We first went up the switchbacks a bit to gain elevation on trail before cutting cross-country northeast towards the streams/drainages. Cutting over was awful and bushwhacky. And then the drainages were crumbly and dirty, steep, and slippery too. Comically easy for dogs to scramble, bad for big-footed humans. Not fun, not recommended, maybe even dangerous if you’re not used to bushwhacking/third class dirt.</p>  <figure>      <img src="talus.jpeg" alt="Crumbly slope opens up to a welcome easy scree field.">      <figcaption>      Crumbly slope opens up to a welcome easy scree field.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Easier cross-country brings a view of Baldwin!</p>  <figure>      <img src="puddle.jpeg" alt="Looking at Baldwin">      <figcaption>      Looking at Baldwin      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Bright Dot Lake is crisp and clear, surprisingly no one was fishing there already.</p>  <figure>      <img src="swim.jpeg" class="small" alt="Cooling off with a swim in Bright Dot Lake, with views of Baldwin">      <figcaption>      Cooling off with a swim in Bright Dot Lake, with views of Baldwin      </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="roll.jpeg" alt="Rolling on the beach">      <figcaption>      Rolling on the beach      </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="baldwin-foot.jpeg" alt="Starting up the slopes">      <figcaption>      Starting up the slopes      </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="use-trail.jpeg" alt="Harder to see in photos, but there's a use trail">      <figcaption>      Harder to see in photos, but there's a use trail      </figcaption>  </figure><p>We were surprised to run into a great use trail that pretty much goes all the way to the summit.</p><p>Partway up are the crystals mentioned by Secor, who says it was a mine (no signs of human structures though).</p>  <figure>      <img src="crystals.jpeg" alt="Crystals!">      <figcaption>      Crystals!      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Aside from short sections of steep dirt, the route is pretty straightforward as far as Sierra peaks go.

We’re back in Mammoth before sunset. Nice day out! SPS 13 for me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I love to eat but I hate to cook, although za is an exception because it feels more like a ✨craft✨ than a chore.</p><p>What I love is really dialing in my technique and process to my home tools (baking steel, bottom-heating oven) and za preferences (infinite cheese! infinite garlic!). Controversially, I don’t think you need an expensive fancy pizza oven to make ridiculously good za, what’s more important is that you reflect on and adjust your technique (like projecting a climb), and you make a LOT of pizza (send, send, send).</p><div class="photos">  <figure>      <img src="za_pesto.jpeg" alt="">      <figcaption>            </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="za_marg.jpeg" alt="">      <figcaption>            </figcaption>  </figure></div><p>I have condensed my eldritch za wisdom into two single-sheet-of-paper zines, so that you can glean the skills without first messing up 200 pizza!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[  <figure>      <img src="woods-isatis2.jpeg" alt="This was how Marco imagined Fontainebleau: alone in the woods, quiet, just you and the rock.">      <figcaption>      This was how Marco imagined Fontainebleau: alone in the woods, quiet, just you and the rock.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>When I could drive in basically any direction and wake up in one of dozens of geologically unique world-class climbing destinations with near self-sufficiency in terms of gear, camping, and cooking, it’s hard to convince myself that the logistical nightmare of an international climbing trip is worth it. It’s easy to forget when your social media is all people cheesing on skis or ropes in some far-flung destination, or even if you got rid of your online presence, your irl friends are always disappearing and coming back from travels before your eyes, and of course they’re going to tell you about it.</p><p>I’ve done these kinds of trips in the past, packing too many sports into checked luggage for mountaineering, climbing, canyoning, and backpacking. When I hear those highlight reels, what I’m thinking about is how annoying it actually is to tesselate ice axe and crampons with wetsuits and drybags, rent a car, find lodging and guidebooks, navigate unfamiliar languages, not be able to pull very hard when jetlagged, and the distainful/bewildered glares in response to “do you have anything vegetarian?”. And I’m not the only one who feels this way.</p>  <figure>      <img src="nz.jpg" alt="Me not being able to pull very hard while jetlagged on my first day in New Zealand (2017). I remember nothing about this climb (including this view??) because I was a zombie the whole time!" class="small">      <figcaption>      Me not being able to pull very hard while jetlagged on my first day in New Zealand (2017). I remember nothing about this climb (including this view??) because I was a zombie the whole time!      </figcaption>  </figure><p>When Marco asked if I wanted to go to Fontainebleau, it was an immediate no. I thought it must have been a joke. We live within an hour drive of more than one lifetime of climbing, highly aspirational destinations for people around the world which we can lazily roll out to after sleeping in, and you want to fly away to a place famous for being hostile to foreigners??</p><p>Ok, reading between the lines, it seemed like it was Marco’s dream to visit the birthplace of bouldering, so I guess it wouldn’t kill me to help make his dream a reality. <em>Where’s your sense of adventure, you spoiled and self-righteous Californian?</em></p><h2 id="“How-was-your-trip-”"><a class="header-anchor" href="#“How-was-your-trip-”">&gt;</a>“How was your trip??”</h2><p>Actually it went pretty ok! Bouldering is the least gear-intensive, so I only had to pack climbing shoes and chalk. In the area there’s a whole culture around the climbing holiday, so lodging came with pad rental. I also had a week before the climbing trip to acclimate to the time zone, which was key. Going to a gym right after getting to Europe, I actually couldn’t convince my fingers to pull hard <em>at all</em>. It came back after a few days of recovery. Amazing, I used to step right off the plane into a europarty.</p><p>The sheer amount of climbing in Fontainebleau is mind-blowing, and the style is super different from what I’m used to (sharp overhanging crimps, flapper factory, crystals for feet). I will never again make fun of the “unrealistic” big volumes with little dimples and bulging pinch grip holds at the gym.</p>  <figure>      <img src="texture.jpeg" alt="Those dinosaur-shaped gym holds weren't made up??">      <figcaption>      Those dinosaur-shaped gym holds weren't made up??      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Fontainebleau is geochemically destined to be composed entirely of slopers and grovelly summit mantles. The style is exactly like the sloper gym climbs that I used to laugh at. Joke’s on me, I have accumulated a big debt of falling off of slopers to work through!</p>  <figure>      <img src="flipflop.jpeg" alt="Time to crank the shit out of these slopers! heck yeah!! My kingdom for a crimp T-T" class="small">      <figcaption>      Time to crank the shit out of these slopers! heck yeah!! My kingdom for a crimp T-T      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Luckily I’m still at the low-ego stage of being a boulderer, so I didn’t really care about grades, and had a blast trying lots of things below my max. Getting the hang of the style meant every day was full of fun body puzzles. It’s wild that a route which spits me out the first couple of tries and feels impossible will become effortless after working through it and finding the right body positioning! I know that’s a very bouldering thing to say, but it felt extra true in a place where the movement was so foreign to me.</p><p>(Note from 1 month later: I went home and was able to send my projects that had top-out slopers, so Fontainebleau sloper bootcamp was highly effective! I hadn’t thought about travel-climbing as an opportunity to collect new skills, but it was a fun and satisfying way to sharpen my weaknesses).</p><figure>    <img src="yoga.jpeg" alt="Marco doing Yoga (7a)">    <figcaption>    <p>Marco doing Yoga (<a href="https://bleau.info/souris/8495.html">7a</a>)</p>    </figcaption></figure><p>In the alpine and the high desert, you can find real stillness. In the forest, you’re never alone. Maybe because the style of this continent is to actually support parenthood, there’s entire sectors that are basically outdoor kindergartens of screaming, running mobs of children rampaging in unselfaware brush-crushing. I’ve never seen anything like it–I’m used to less kids and more dogs (which are much less susceptible to the crush of capitalism and thus better adapted to the States). We definitely found areas where there were no people at all, but without local context it’s hard to tell what you’re going to get before you get there. In the depopulated spots, the children are replace by screaming birds, which is somehow not as idyllic as you might imagine.</p>  <figure>      <img src="desert.jpeg" alt="Accidentally in an extremely popular tourist destination. 'Les sables du Cul de Chien' (dog butt sand): a sealess beach stranded in the middle of the forest.">      <figcaption>      Accidentally in an extremely popular tourist destination. 'Les sables du Cul de Chien' (dog butt sand): a sealess beach stranded in the middle of the forest.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>In general, deciding “where do we climb tomorrow” was challenging! I’m really glad we got the physical <a href="http://www.jingowobbly.com/ROC7/ROC7-main.html">guide book</a>. It’s hard enough to navigate the maze of rocks <em>with</em> it, even with the route numbers painted right on the rock (!!), I can’t imagine trying to rely on the uncacheable web maps on <a href="https://bleau.info">bleau.info</a>. The book is in English, but interpreting the symbology and graphic design itself is a foreign language. Theoretically you can glean where the shade and sun is, so we spent a lot of time looking up the weather and studying the book. Marco had a strategy of looking up highly rated climbs online and popular youtube beta videos as a starting point for picking areas. I think as long as there’s climbs marked in your range, you can’t really go wrong. If you don’t like what you see, walk a minute up the trail and there’s a billion more routes.</p>  <figure>      <img src="flapper.jpeg" alt="Warming up on some slippery slab">      <figcaption>      Warming up on some slippery slab      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Another interesting thing is that Font grades go way lower than v-grades. There’s so many Font grades below v0, which actually makes sense considering a Bishop v0 can be impossible for beginners. Part of what makes this place interesting is the history, but while bouldering was born in Fontainebleau, the climbing films are made in Bishop/Yosemite, so surprisingly a lot of USian climbers haven’t heard of Fontainebleau (even after this past Reel Rock??).</p><p>Aside from the heat wave, my biggest struggle was with food, and eating has always felt like a big component to my strength. I am always jealous of my friends who can climb a whole day on bars alone, or “forget” to eat lunch (how??), I’d fall over dead if I didn’t pack real food and consume it on schedule. At home I usually eat as many sandwiches as I want without a problem, but somehow the French diet of bread and cheese had me bloated and inflamed by the end of the trip. Mysteries!</p>  <figure>      <img src="sandwich.jpeg" alt="Assembling my sando at the crag" class="small">      <figcaption>      Assembling my sando at the crag      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Some people probably climb Fontainebleau to eat amazing French food on rest days, and it’s going to get me permanently banned from the country to put this on the public record, but I was not impressed. I <em>think</em> it’s because I’m vegetarian, and everything seems to be sprinkled with a fine dust of meat byproducts. Even the most innocuous-looking savory pastries have meat bits. It feels weird to say my favourite eating-out experience in France was Indian food. I also had the revelation that I prefer salty croissants, and all the croissants I had here were sweet (now I’m going to be double-banned).</p>  <figure>      <img src="potata-acid.jpeg" alt="Now that's a nice smooth edge...too smooth??">      <figcaption>      Now that's a nice smooth edge...too smooth??      </figcaption>  </figure><p>In Bishop, you sometimes have to stop climbing because you’ve literally run out of skin, but the Fontainebleau sandstone is much more gentle, which just means you need some other indicator that it’s time for a rest day (such as surprise rain).</p><p>It’s just so moist. It can get hot in May so we had to be smart about chasing shade (which I’m used to), but you can’t avoid the humidity (which I’m not used to). If Florida had rocks, that’s how I imagine climbing there would feel. I live in the desert where I don’t really need to towel off after bathing, I just wipe the water off my body with my hands and I’m naturally desiccated by the time I’ve stepped from the shower to my clothes. The towel is really just for simulating the comforting hug of a tame bear to top off your cleansing experience.</p><p>Whereas in Fontainebleau, you put out the dishes to dry and the next morning they’re wetter than when you last saw them. The uncovered salt turns into one big clump. The shade-facing laundry hung up to dry is damp forever. I felt like physics itself was out of whack. A heat wave kicked in at the end of the trip and I basically spend 1.5 days laying on the ground unable to get up. I actually took off my pants on the last day and climbed in my underwear because it was just!! too!! hot!!</p>  <figure>      <img src="potata.jpeg" alt="Bring me back to the cold first days. I had to redirect a millipede off a foot hold because the forest is alive and we're just visitors in the critters' home.">      <figcaption>      Bring me back to the cold first days. I had to redirect a millipede off a foot hold because the forest is alive and we're just visitors in the critters' home.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>So there you have it, my international climbing trip as a skeptic: bouldering simplicity minimises airplane-equipment-shenanigans, it’s fun to get out of what you’re familiar with and be puzzled by a totally unfamiliar style of rock, holy shit I’m being consumed by a living kid-tornado, other times total solitude, food sucks.</p><p>Do I regret going? no. Will I go again? Probably not, unless it’s in a bigger group and a cooler time of year. Or maybe if I’m slowly traveling through the area and make a stop. I’d definitely not hop on a plane just for this. But you know me, I like to take the long way.</p>  <figure>      <img src="woods-isatis.jpeg" alt="Goodbye forest">      <figcaption>      Goodbye forest      </figcaption>  </figure><hr><h1>Bonus Material</h1><p>Here’s some of my raw journals (I usually draw them in the morning about the day before) if you’re curious about the source content:</p>  <figure>      <img src="220503.jpeg" alt="May 3, 2022" class="small">      <figcaption>      May 3, 2022      </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="220506.jpeg" alt="May 6, 2022" class="small">      <figcaption>      May 6, 2022      </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="220507.jpeg" alt="May 7, 2022" class="small">      <figcaption>      May 7, 2022      </figcaption>  </figure><h2 id="Talking-logistics"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Talking-logistics">&gt;</a>Talking logistics</h2><h3 id="Transportation"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Transportation">&gt;</a>Transportation</h3><p>You can take the train 1 hour from Paris, and there’s certainly climbing spots you could get to by walking, but you need a car if you want to do a grand tour of all the forest has to offer. And if you’re going to come all the way from the States, it felt silly to be limited to only what could be accessed by foot. We rented a car from the airport.</p><p>Gaia (map app) was useful and has the trails and lots of climbing spots annotated.</p><h3 id="Lodging"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Lodging">&gt;</a>Lodging</h3><p>We stayed in a bungalow, rented tent, then cabane in a glamping resort called Ile de Boulancourt. I don’t know if I’d necessarily recommend it, we were both allergic to the cabins, the owner yelled a lot (at me and at random children), they didn’t realise we were coming and didn’t respond to email. Maybe that’s just how it is here.</p><p>It seems like 2 is not a great group size for Fontainebleau: doesn’t scale well with hostel pricing, yet too small to rent out a nice gite. I guess it’s the kind of place you visit with your crew (or whole fam).</p><h3 id="Data"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Data">&gt;</a>Data</h3><p>I used Airalo for mobile data, but be warned that the French plan was useless and I barely had any connectivity (the pan-Europe plan was much better).</p><h2 id="Rest-day-activities-and-Forest-fun"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Rest-day-activities-and-Forest-fun">&gt;</a>Rest day activities and Forest fun</h2><p>Wake up campers, you aren’t in California anymore!

We drove past a massive pit in the ground tastefully hidden by a manicured tree screen, but you can catch a glimpse of the mine between the gaps. Apparently le Louvre is made from Fontainebleau glass.</p><p>I was really curious about the local geology, and had a hard time finding English-language explanations. I did find a bunch of blog posts from glass enthusiasts, and some geology papers, including this fun one where <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282119531_The_Fontainebleau_Sandstone_bleaching_silicification_and_calcite_precipitation_under_periglacial_conditions">a geochemistry conference goes on a field trip to Fontainebleau</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure>    <img src="happys.jpeg">    <figcaption>    <p>Happy boulders in January, with <a href="/blog/basin-mountain/">Basin Mountain</a> &amp; Mt Tom rising up behind.</p>    </figcaption></figure><p>Happy new year! 🐯 新年快乐</p><p>In the current revision of my life, I find myself bouldering outdoors basically as much as my body can handle without actually imploding. Last month I made the 2-hour round-trip commute to Bishop 13 days out of 31:</p>  <figure>      <img src="january.jpg" alt="That's a lot of bouldering!" class="small">      <figcaption>      That's a lot of bouldering!      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Last season I gave bouldering a real try for the first time, and I managed to struggled up a couple v1’s between cold swollen toes, hip injury, and general fears being outside my rope-climbing comfort zone (I’m short, all the holds are far away and bad, I’m weak and only manage to climb with cardio and technique, I don’t want to fall and break my leg, a 5-minute approach is for bums and my true passion is hiking a bag of ropes and metal deep into the backcountry, etc).</p>  <figure>      <img src="monkey-hang.jpeg" alt="Monkey Hang v3. Leo for best spotter!">      <figcaption>      Monkey Hang v3. Leo for best spotter!      </figcaption>  </figure><p>It’s been 6 weeks into my second season, and I have already climbed six v3’s??? and am working v4-5. Exciting! Shocking?? This doesn’t make any sense considering I mostly climbed moderate alpine/trad all summer, popped a finger on the kilterboard at the start of October, and continued to not really climb until mid-December. Does training even mean anything?? who knows.</p>  <figure>      <img src="hobo_said-last-season.jpeg" alt="">      <figcaption>            </figcaption>  </figure><p>A plausible contributing factor: six weeks ago, my hip spontaneously collapsed and I could barely walk for a two weeks (labral tear relapse?). No longer was I distracted with all my other hobbies, such as trail running, XC skiing, downhill skiing, the hip-intensive descent to the Gorge, and walking through the grocery store or up the stairs. Somehow, I could still boulder. I can’t explain it.</p><p>So as the gears of time clicked into place at the start of 2022 our year of Luigi, my friends carried all the pads, my stuff, and sometimes me to the Happy, Sad, or Buttermilk boulders every weekend. I used hiking poles as crutches to limp around. By the time I navigated my new insurance to re-begin physical therapy, I was already climbing 2 grades harder than I had before my injury, yet comically living in constant fear of opening a car door while standing on the icy driveway, or turning my foot the wrong way while laying in bed.</p>  <figure>      <img src="pood.jpeg" alt="Fuzzy organism spotted at the Milks.">      <figcaption>      Fuzzy organism spotted at the Milks.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Being totally focused on 1 thing is surprisingly nice. I’m still at the low-ego new-activity stage so I don’t feel bad if I don’t succeed, I just feel good to be out of the house and able to do anything that feels normal and empowering. And it’s a lot more fun now that I’m at a level where I can project with friends (I’ve also made friends closer to my level and size in the last year, and that’s made a big difference too).</p>  <figure>      <img src="sads.jpeg" alt="Evening Sads. 100% of the cars here were for Beefcake.">      <figcaption>      Evening Sads. 100% of the cars here were for Beefcake.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Being injured in a way that isn’t legible to others leaves me feeling pathetic a lot of the time because I need to ask simple favours from people who probably think I’m just really lazy and bothering them. When I feel too prideful and try to attempt the task myself, I get hurt and end up setting my recovery back, but asking for stuff really sucks. While rehabilitating a functionally useless wrist/hand/elbow a couple of years ago, my doctor suggested wearing a wrist brace at work, partially as a signal to others so they don’t judge me when I ask for favors or exemptions (such as declining to take notes at a meeting or move heavy objects). I think about that a lot. Aside from walking around with a limp or sometimes spontaneously collapsing, I otherwise appear totally normal. Most days, I feel lucky that I can do anything at all.</p>  <figure>      <img src="hobo_milks.jpeg" alt="">      <figcaption>            </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="hobo_mlk.jpeg" alt="">      <figcaption>            </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="hobo_sore.jpeg" alt="">      <figcaption>            </figcaption>  </figure><h3 id="Bishop-v3-Progression"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Bishop-v3-Progression">&gt;</a>Bishop v3 Progression</h3><p>Listing here in order of send, in case you were wondering which are the easiest v3’s (and v2’s) in Bishop ;D</p><ol><li>🥰 Pirate Booty v3 - first Bishop v3!

This was my first time out of the country in 2.5 years(??!) which is wild considering I used to travel so much that people had the impression that I was permanently on the road even after a whole year of living in one spot.</p><figure><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/890761303&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=false"></iframe><figcaption>(Passport by Masego, the soundtrack for this post \o/)</figcaption></figure><p>I was actually apprehensive about meeting people after my lukewarm post-vaccine social re-expansion. In a low-meeting lab environment without mantatory corporate happy hour bonding, I had just a vague impression of most of the characters orbiting the lab sphere. Throwing ten people into a Victorian mansion airbnb for a week could be risky, considering some disasterous shared-house offsites I have had (a story for another time). You know how nerds can be mean in subtle and surprising ways. In the typical pre-travel anxiety rise, I considered accidentally canceling my flight or faking my disappearance. In the end I took the required $200 PCR COVID test and Canadá let me in without additional fanfare.</p>  <figure>      <img src="mossy-tree.jpeg" alt="It's so wet here that the trees have become moss.">      <figcaption>      It's so wet here that the trees have become moss.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>In reality I had a really great time! The interests of the lab attract people who care about technology and also people, so I found everyone to be very cool and also kind and perceptive. After living in a mountain town of infinite outdoors stoke but not much art and computer stoke, it was super energising to be around multidisciplinary nerds. One of us commented on day 2 that we’d probably been talking continuously for 30 hours at that point, so maybe everyone had been somewhat deprived of this.</p>  <figure>      <img src="party-sketch.jpeg" alt="Doodles of my colleagues">      <figcaption>      Doodles of my colleagues      </figcaption>  </figure><p>We did design jam sessions. We started out taking ubers around town and by the end we were taking the bus as a group, because it was easier to use public transit. We stayed up late sharing youtube videos of weird music/sound art. What’s amazing about this type of social environment is that people are SO EXCITED about something that I am swept up into activities I would otherwise never do voluntarily, like watching a recap of the 2021 chess world championship as if it were an Olympic event. It’s like how I can’t help but dance when I go to a dance party and everyone is moving and the vibe is all-consuming. And it just felt so different than how I’ve been living for the last nearly 2 years. I felt like a dormant part of me revived from hibernation, eager to CONSUME.</p><figure><video preload="auto" muted="" controls="" src="worm.mp4" alt="that's all there is, measuring worm"></video><figcaption>An animation doodle I made in Looom. It's a phone video because that's the only way I could figure out how to add background music!</figcaption></figure>  <figure>      <img src="cloudy-beach.jpeg" alt="I visited the cold beach and saw many container ships queued up.">      <figcaption>      I visited the cold beach and saw many container ships queued up.      </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="wild-buns.jpeg" alt="Wild buns of Vancouver">      <figcaption>      Wild buns of Vancouver      </figcaption>  </figure><p>What I got to see of Vancouver the city was AWESOME. I’d only previously driven through on my way to climb in Squamish. Even walking down main street lined with night cafes and restaurants was exciting! (to the amusement of my London/NYC hosts). There’s so many dogs, and they all have rain jackets. I felt safer with nearly every restraurant and even cafes checked for COVID vaccination; I’d never had to do that in the states. It was surprisingly pleasant to hear Chinese on the streets. It’s easy for me to devalue my increasingly distant motherculture, but the primal familiarity of a heritage language pierces through my rational brain.</p>  <figure>      <img src="spilled-disco.jpeg" alt="Imagine being the person whose job it is to spill the disco balls into the pond">      <figcaption>      Imagine being the person whose job it is to spill the disco balls into the pond      </figcaption>  </figure><p>I had some down time to visit friends old and new. Hearing peoples’ immigration stories always feels so unfair and personal. Seeing formerly iterant friends settle is bittersweet, part empathetic happiness and part yearning to feel at home somewhere, too. Maybe I’m emotionally vunerable to being extra city-struck, but I could almost see myself living here, if I hadn’t already eliminated the possibility of happiness in Berlin-core gloom. When the sun did come out, it was magical.</p>  <figure>      <img src="skyline.jpeg" alt="Shiny Vancouver.">      <figcaption>      Shiny Vancouver.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>–<br><em>Looking back on this trip, I’d entered Canada just days before omicron was declared. We joked nervously about whether we’d be allowed to return to our respective home countries. That trip felt like the last collective carefree moment before the mood changed and places plunged into varying degrees of COVID lockdown and stress again.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I mention <abbr title="Wilderness First Responder">WFR</abbr> to other climbers (or anyone who spends extended time outdoors), I hear a lot of “oh I’ve been meaning to take <em>Wuhfer</em>! but haven’t been able to make the time/money/travel”.</p><p>It’s been years since I learned about WFR through a friend and became determined to do it, yet it is only now that I finally overcame the somewhat conflicting lifestyle implications of:</p><ol><li><p>having two consecutive weeks of free time during a course offering (waitlists fill up months in advanced) to go to school when I could be climbing/backpacking/traveling instead, and</p></li><li><p>having a discretionary $1000+ laying around for tuition/etc.</p></li></ol><p>I am now a Wilderness First Responder! It was <strong>awesome</strong> and if you’ve been thinking about it, you should definitely go for it!</p><div class="photo-small">  <figure>      <img src="yey.jpeg" alt="The certificate is still in the mail but until then I have this snake sticker \o/">      <figcaption>      The certificate is still in the mail but until then I have this snake sticker \o/      </figcaption>  </figure></div><h2 id="My-educational-experience-at-WFR"><a class="header-anchor" href="#My-educational-experience-at-WFR">&gt;</a>My educational experience at WFR</h2><p>Two weeks ago, I drove down to Bishop and took the 80 hour certification course that crams a semester of material into <em>10 days</em>(!!) It’s basically as intense as it sounds. Class is 8am to 5pm (9 hours), including two days with evening sessions, and one rest day. I knew all this going in, but it still felt even more brutal and whirlwind than I had imagined.</p>  <figure>      <img src="rainbow.jpeg" alt="A lucky desert rainbow greets us as I roll up to the first day of class :D">      <figcaption>      A lucky desert rainbow greets us as I roll up to the first day of class :D      </figcaption>  </figure><p>I hang out with nerds a lot so I am self-conscious about admiting that I did not thrive in and have no love for a classroom setting. I was actually pretty nervous about voluntarily inducing myself into a school-shaped experience! especially after some disasterous attempts at college.</p><p>But despite having an exam at the end, nothing else about WFR was like traditional school. I really liked being in a place where the other students all <em>wanted</em> to be there, and if passion isn’t enough, the $860 tuition ensured skin in the game.</p>  <figure>      <img src="foot.jpeg" alt="Practicing ankle wraps on each other">      <figcaption>      Practicing ankle wraps on each other      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Every morning I arrived full of coffee, and in the evening I left full of KNOWLEDGE. We built up to a full patient assessment system, drilled it until I caught my brain whispering questions to invisible patients as I fell asleep at night, and powered through physical trauma and medical topics. We learned to split broken stuff and package patient for transport in commercial equipment, and also whatever gear we had laying around based on the sport we were just doing.</p><p>For splint improv day, the instructors told us to bring some things we’d normally have on our wilderness excursions, so people showed up with skis, hiking poles, climbing cordalette, and even a pulaski(!) I learned that the foam frame and buckle cinches of my first-gen Patagonia Ascensionist climbing pack makes it a great ad-hoc splint base :’) These are the true Dark Arts which we all hope will never need to be used.</p>  <figure>      <img src="classroom.jpeg" alt="Our bright, COVID-safe outdoor classroom.">      <figcaption>      Our bright, COVID-safe outdoor classroom.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>The winter desert sun was alternatingly too cold and too hot, but we spent almost the entire lecture portion outdoors in our makeshift classroom of camp chairs and picnic blankets, which migrated between the sun and shade depending on the conditions. When we had to masked up and head inside to use the projector, I got really sleepy and fought to pay attention. Around the room I saw a lot of wilted necks, which quickly revitalised after moving back outside. The contrast was like night and day. It’s hard to believe I spent so many heavy years in one dank box of artificial lights after another, when moving air and real sun makes me feel 10 times more focused??</p>  <figure>      <img src="clouds.jpeg" alt="The urge to distract myself by looking at my phone during lecture was overpowered by this irl view of the Sierra ✨">      <figcaption>      The urge to distract myself by looking at my phone during lecture was overpowered by this irl view of the Sierra ✨      </figcaption>  </figure><p>People take WFR for a wide variety of reasons, both recreational (climbers and backpackers who saw one too many accidents, outdoor group leaders, backcountry skiers, even someone who described themself as just a moderate dayhiker) and professional (National Parks Service employees who wanted to qualify for specific roles, aspiring ski patrollers, and people pursuing outdoor careers were paying their own tab—surprisingly no employer sponsorship).</p><p>I met a lot of dads but (to my knowledge) no moms. Many people were living out of their vehicles, and we were swapping van tours during breaks. There were young vagrants attached to nothing, older people on the verge of retirement, and people firmly established in adulthood but at a crossroads.</p>  <figure>      <img src="discussion.jpeg" alt="Circling up to debrief after a scenario">      <figcaption>      Circling up to debrief after a scenario      </figcaption>  </figure><p>I stayed with some friends in Bishop and was super glad to save the daily two hour round trip commute to where I’m living in Mammoth. Students came from far and wide; fancy people rented airbnbs while car nomads were camped nearby at <a href="https://www.blm.gov/visit/pv-pit-campground">the Pit</a>.</p><p>In the mornings, I woke up between 6 and 6:30am. I would savour my coffee, eat a big breakfast, hang out with the friends I was crashing with, and drive 10 minutes to the campus at White Mountain Research Center. I found myself super hungry ALL THE TIME and was eventually eating <em>two</em> sandwiches for lunch. I had forgotten how much energy learning took out of me! A couple days in I made an extra grocery run for fruit because I was having uncharacteristic sugar cravings, a side effect of focusing intensely that I find unintuitive. (I thought brains liked fat?)</p><div class="photo-small">  <figure>      <img src="sugar.jpeg" alt="I don't usually want fruit or sugar that much, but it's what brains crave?">      <figcaption>      I don't usually want fruit or sugar that much, but it's what brains crave?      </figcaption>  </figure></div><p>There were textbook chapters assigned for each evening, but I was so beat, it was a legendary struggle to make it through any of it. I tried sitting under a bright lamp, but my eyes could not stay focused. I was eventually falling asleep before 9pm(!!)</p>  <figure>      <img src="texts.jpeg" alt="Textbook, spiral notebook (which organised concepts way better than the textbook did), and handy clipboard for jotting notes during lectures and vitals during scenarios.">      <figcaption>      Textbook, spiral notebook (which organised concepts way better than the textbook did), and handy clipboard for jotting notes during lectures and vitals during scenarios.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>In retrospect, I didn’t need to worry about studying in the evenings and should have just relaxed instead. The instructors and curriculum did a great job of maximally packing knowledge into our bodies! The instructors Dan and Viren were really engaging and had great stage presence, wild personal experience stories to go with the subject material, and their lecture style is overall highly memorable. We practiced multiple scenarios a day and review was built in so that I knew as much as I ever would by exam day. Out of nervousness I made one last attempt to study, and fell asleep with the book on my face as I did the other nights. The gesture was valiant but unnecessary. Everyone in the class passed the written test and the practical, which I think was destined if you made at least a moderate effort to pay attention to what the instructors said, and take part in the scenarios.</p>  <figure>      <img src="night.jpeg" alt="Rounding up for our evening scenario near the end of the course, where we put together our learnings into a realistic rescue.

When you hear those sirens coming for you, you better hope it’s one snake (Asclepius, healing) and not two (Hermes, prolific Olympian psychopomp and guide to the afterlife).</p><h2 id="My-emotional-experience-at-WFR"><a class="header-anchor" href="#My-emotional-experience-at-WFR">&gt;</a>My emotional experience at WFR</h2><p>The pandemic era has been an uncertainty and exhaustion machine. You hear a lot of bad things happening everywhere. Big fires, floods and hurricanes, war, civil unrest, cracks in the fabric of society swallowing the people holding it together. I warded against immobilising helplessness with the COVID-safe workout plan: more climbing, more hiking, trying out trail running, skiing, and crosscountry skiing. My mind doesn’t have the mental energy to fester in unproductive negative thoughts if it’s already exhausted from cardio, but this strategy is at the expense of becoming detached from reality, and disconnected from emotional processing.</p><p>Taking WFR was an extremely grounding experience. It gave me a sense of confidence, frameworks to approach disasters, a shared vocabulary with other emergency personel, and many hours of practice exercising professional calm while interacting with distressed people. This is probably totally dilusional, but doing WFR felt like taking a sliver of control back from this chaotic world.</p>  <figure>      <img src="sunrise.jpeg" alt="Sunrise on the last day of class, good omens for an unknown future.">      <figcaption>      Sunrise on the last day of class, good omens for an unknown future.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>I have also slowly been coming unhinged. I think it’s appropriate to shield myself from the ups and downs of daily life, but at some point I have to face myself in a big-picture sense. I had always lived in cities to increase exposure to lots of different kinds of people. A serving of ambition, a serving of anarchy, a serving of hippie sentimentality and coporate pragmatism: keeping reminders of all that I can be at finger-tip’s reach. In March of 2020, I and the rest of the world exited that scene and dug into our holes for the long winter. But when normal life started trickling back, I did not return to the spring of human possibility and dynamism.</p><p>A lot of the human interactions I’ve had lately have been disappointing, misogynistic, or otherwise mind-numbingly boring (I recognise that while every human is a cosmos of unique hopes and dreams, sometimes the context of our interactions are hostile to revealing our inner complexities and instead thrust us into endless, inescapable, horrible small-talk). WFR functioned as a filtration system for interesting people, those who threw good sense out the window to spend 2 long and tough weeks in a desert learning wilderness medicine day and night.</p><p>Like in real life, I didn’t get along with everyone, and there were definitely personality clashes, but overwhelmingly it felt refreshing and energising to be around people inspecting and questioning their life, or pursuing an interest that will not directly result in improving their athleticism or increasing their salary, or bravely exploring a new career path. It kind of reminded me of my hitchhiking and couchsurfing days, where I often met people who didn’t have much, but were stoked to be alive and eager to do things and think wide thoughts. In Mammoth, I seem to be meeting the same person over and over again in an endless waking nightmare. I needed to break out of the cycle of being surrounded by people turning inward, or doing their lives as if it was a chore. This is crazy to me because I expect Mammoth to be full of weird vagrants and fun-loving travellers. I think I’ve burrowed too deeply into my hole and am suffocating inside it. I need to stop thinking and just go do something. Once I get moving, it will feel natural.</p>  <figure>      <img src="sunset.jpeg" alt="Sunset at the outdoor classroom, a natural closure.">      <figcaption>      Sunset at the outdoor classroom, a natural closure.      </figcaption>  </figure>]]></content:encoded>

Jk I was playing video games.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Merino wool is very important to me, a sweaty monster that struggles with temperature regulation, because it doesn’t feel terrible to sweat into yet also keeps you toasty on the other end of the climate spectrum. It’s a popular activewear material for its natural antimicrobial/antiodor properties, which it presumably inherits from its days of living on a sheep. I have found the hype to be real: camp out of a vehicle for a while and it becomes evident who is wearing synthetics (ripens quickly, like a banana), cotton (honorable mention), or merino (actual miracle fiber).</p><p>The downsides to merino are that it’s fragile, and heckin spendy (I guess it’s cheaper to make plastics than wait for sheep to grow), which is how I ended up hoarding a pair of mortally wounded merino leggings beyond its usefulness, unwilling to throw away the precious material that had dutifully warmed my legs in the backcountry for 6+ years.</p><div class="photo-small">  <figure>      <img src="riperoni.jpeg" alt="Unspeakable backcountry butt shenanigans caused these fatal wounds that I am not powerful enough to dress.

This inspired me to try sewing them myself :D</p>  <figure>      <img src="leggings-cut.jpeg" alt="Using scissors on clothes feels so wrong.

Turns out my leg width is also my neck width. I just had to darn a small hole.</p><div class="photos">  <figure>      <img src="buff.jpeg" alt="Wool buff keeps your neck warm and can be deployed to conceal your true intentions over Zoom calls.">      <figcaption>      Wool buff keeps your neck warm and can be deployed to conceal your true intentions over Zoom calls.      </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure>      <img src="beanie.jpeg" alt="Tie one end of the buff together to make a hat.

The tubes ended up being straightforward to sew. For the thumbs, I just left holes. I’m considering adding thumb attachments in the future, although the nice thing about the simple tube is that I can use them as running mitts by folding them over my hands. And also, I’m lazy.</p>  <figure>      <img src="arm-seam.jpeg" alt="That's it for the sewing.">      <figcaption>      That's it for the sewing.      </figcaption>  </figure><h3 id="Conclusion"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Conclusion">&gt;</a>Conclusion</h3><p>A success! I’ve been wearing these new, un-holey accessories nonstop (maybe I should figure out how to use the so-called smart thermostat).</p><p>What should I do with the leftover fabric? There’s quite a bit but the shape is irregular, and I don’t have more cylindrical body parts left in need of coverage. Maybe I could double-layers the hand warmers, my hands are always freezing T_T</p>]]></content:encoded>

And the preview pages also won’t appear on your production sitemap/rss feeds/other generated indeces since the static site generator doesn’t know about it while compiling the production version of the site. If you’re worried about that, it may be prudent to use ENV flags to conditionally toggle off production stuff in the PR preview sites, like web crawler indexing (<code>noindex,nofollow</code>, <code>robots.txt</code>, etc). In my example, I set <code>HUGO_ENV: production</code> for <code>main</code> and <code>HUGO_ENV: staging</code> for PRs. You can look into if your static site generator/theme supports that.</p><p>Also I am not compelled to spend the energy to become a workflow configuration language expert and I’m sure it could be written with more elegance, if that is a concept that can be applied to yaml files. Feel free to make a PR and show me how it should be done :D</p><p>Let me know if you use this strategy! I found <a href="https://github.com/adriangb/gh-pages-docs">someone else’s</a> attempt at implementing this idea but thought I’d try my own hand at it (and also completing the “delete preview on PR close” feature). I’m curious if someone else out there wants to make PR previews for gh pages for some weird reason \o/</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Like any good cooking blog, here’s the link to <a href="#dye-the-keycaps">jump to recipe</a>.</em></p><p><img src="mbk_dyed_keycaps.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I found myself here because I use Kailh Choc switches on my One True Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard, the Corne LP. The Choc switches have a unique shape like an American wall outlet and thus are only compatible with weird American plug-shaped keycaps. Choc keycaps seem to only come in black and white, which misses out on the fun customisation the rest of the mechanical keyboard world enjoys. <a href="https://mkultra.click/mbk-colors">MKUltra batch dyes Choc-compatible keycaps</a> but it’s usually out of stock and the shades are more crayon-like than I’d prefer.</p><p>If you are reading this, you may have fallen into the same dark rabbithole of mechanical keyboard customization as I have, and if a primal urge haunts you to bring the non-commercially produced palette of your dreams into the light of reality then take solace: I have studied the reddit and discord lore, tried it for myself, and have distilled the wisdom from the internet and my own experience into this handy document.</p><p>Note that my process involved elaborate backflips to make a gradient from the three primary colours while trying to minimise waste and work around COVID supply chain issues. You may be able to skip some steps by buying more dyes.</p><p>An outline of the steps I took:</p><ul><li><a href="#assemble-the-tools">Assemble the tools</a></li><li><a href="#make-a-plan">Make a plan</a></li><li><a href="#dye-the-keycaps">Dye the keycaps</a><ul><li><a href="#preparation">Preparation</a></li><li><a href="#mix-the-colours">Mix the colours</a></li><li><a href="#put-the-caps-into-the-dye">Put the caps into the dye</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#results">Results</a></li></ul><h2 id="Assemble-the-tools"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Assemble-the-tools">&gt;</a>Assemble the tools</h2><p>I spent a couple of weeks passively accumulating these things. You could probably do it faster if you didn’t stubbornly aim to fish them out your house recycling bin like I did.</p><ol><li><code>White PBT keycaps</code></li></ol><ul><li><a href="https://keyboard.university/100-courses/keycaps-101#block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583663864235_13786">Keycaps are made with plastic</a>, either with ABS (lower melting point) or PBT (higher melting point). I used PBT here, I heard that ABS will deform in the boiling dye bath.</li><li>Note that finger oil or UV damage from older keycaps can cause irregularities. I used newish secondhand keycaps and it is only noticable up close.</li><li>If you’re buying new keycaps for this, might as well get extras in case you goof or want to experiment with colours. I did not have extras, so it was a measure thrice, cut once kind of deal.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li><code>iDye Poly</code>, a plastic dye. Make sure to get the Poly version, the iDye Natural will not work on plastics.</li></ol><ul><li>I got the three primary colours Blue, Yellow, and Red because colour theory would lead me to believe that I could get all of the colours for the price of 3. Pigments, unlike digital pixels, cannot actually mix into literally every colour, so if you go with this approach be sure to know its limitations. For example, if you want pink caps, you may want to get a pink dye.</li><li>Support your local art supply store! Otherwise <a href="https://www.dharmatrading.com/dyes/idye-for-natural-and-poly-fabrics.html">this</a> is a good online source.</li><li>I have read in older tutorials that Rit Dyemore (another plastics dye) doesn’t work as well. Have not confirmed personally.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li><code>Small jars with lids, or ziplocks</code>, for storing extra dye power.</li></ol><ul><li>iDye Poly comes as a powder in a dissolvable pouch meant to be tossed entirely into a buck to dye heaps of fabrics, so for a handful of keycaps you don’t need very much of it.</li><li>I find that containers much easier to use than plastic ziplock bags because they stay upright and are easy to pour from. If you use ziplock bags, you may need a plastic spoon to get small amounts of powder out.</li></ul><ol start="4"><li><code>Glass jars</code> for mixing dye colours and dying, if you don’t want to ruin a cooking pot.</li></ol><ul><li>If you don’t care about ruining a cooking pot, note that you’ll have to thoroughly wash the pot between each dye colour, potentially with bleach (according to some sources). I used the glass jars tactic to avoid this hassle.</li></ul><ol start="5"><li><code>Small pot</code> for boiling water.</li></ol><ul><li>it just needs to be big enough to fit a glass jar from step 4 above.</li><li>I boiled water in this pot, and placed the glass jars of dye into the boiling water to heat it. The dye does not contact the pot, so it continues to be food-safe.</li></ul><ol start="6"><li><p><code>Chopsticks</code> or other way to fish the keycaps out of the dye. Maybe a plastic takeout spoon would work too. I saw internet advice that metal should be avoided as it may cause scratches.</p></li><li><p><code>Distilled, filtered, or otherwise non-shitty water</code></p></li></ol><ul><li>The tap water where I live is really gross in the winter and precipitates white flecks when boiled. The flecks will stick to your keycaps and cause weird discoloration.</li></ul><ol start="8"><li><p><code>Rags or paper towels</code> for the inevitable mess</p></li><li><p><code>Gloves</code>, if you don’t want your hands to get smelly and colourful</p></li><li><p><code>Non-food-safe container</code> for rinsing. As to not sacrifice a pot forever you could use a yogurt container or paint water can or hair bleach bowl or anything you never plan to eat out of again.</p></li><li><p><code>Induction cooktop/hot plate (optional)</code>.</p></li></ol><ul><li>The hot dye smells bad so I took it outside. If you have a fume hood, that might be sufficient.</li></ul><ol start="12"><li><code>Stopwatch (optional)</code>. For science.</li></ol><h2 id="Make-a-plan"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Make-a-plan">&gt;</a>Make a plan</h2><p>If your keys are not interchangable, and you want to make a gradient with many colours, then you need a plan. For example, on my keyboard, all keys are interchangable except the 2 homing keys (keys with bumps so you know where to place your hands without looking) which are always at the F and J position (in QWERTY), and two 1.5u sized keys that always go at the thumbs:</p><p><img src="mbk_white_on_corne_annotated.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I photoshopped some prototypes to get a feel for what colour scheme I liked (very rudimentary, I did this on my phone):</p><p><img src="keycap_color_prototypes.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I traced my keyboard on paper and drew out the keys, using colored pens to mark which keys would be which colour group based on the prototype:</p><p><img src="paper_keycap_map.jpg" alt=""></p><p>And then I PHYSICALY placed keycaps onto my drawing, making sure to put the special keys (homing keys and thumb keys) in their exact positions. Then I removed the keys by colour group, placing them physically together, and annotating which group they were in:</p><p><img src="keycap_color_groups.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Most of this planning is probably overkill for most people, but because I didn’t have any extra keycaps and also was making a colour scheme where the homing keys needed to be in a specific position, I did not want to make any mistake. Use whatever strategy works for you!</p><h2 id="Dye-the-keycaps"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Dye-the-keycaps">&gt;</a>Dye the keycaps</h2><h3 id="Preparation"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Preparation">&gt;</a>Preparation</h3><p>From my hair dying experience I went into this first by putting on plastic gloves with towels ready.</p><ol><li><p>Carefully cut the dye packets and poured them into the small containers (or ziplocks). I suggest you do this in a sink or bathtub because it could go catastrophically wrong. Make sure the containers are dry!<br><img src="idye_poly.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="idye_poly_in_cups.jpg" alt=""></p></li><li><p>If your keycaps are used, wash them in soap. If they are new, maybe wash them anyway, who knows where they’ve been.<br><img src="washing_keycaps.jpg" alt=""></p></li><li><p>Fill the food-safe pot with water and set it aside to boil on the hotplate.</p></li><li><p>Fill the non-food-safe rinsing container with water and set it next to the boiling pot.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Mix-the-colours"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Mix-the-colours">&gt;</a>Mix the colours</h3><p>I mixed the colours in the glass jars one at a time, since I was learning on the fly.</p><ol><li><p>Pour a small amount of water into the glass jar until it could cover all the keys you plan to dye at once, that’s all you need. I was dying 6 keys at time, so I used very little water.</p></li><li><p>Add a pinch of dye powder into the water (a metaphorical pinch. I would not actually touch the powder with my hands). If you want pastels, you need to REALLY dilute the colours. I mean really seriously dilute them. Because I was mixing in such small jars, I barely needed to use a dusting of powder. It’s better to dye the keys too light than too dark, because you can still fix your mistake. Imagine you’re putting habenero sauce or sichuan chilis into a soup. That’s right. You’re playing with fire.</p></li><li><p>Put the glass jar of dye into the pot of boiling water, wait a bit for it to heat up. Stir it with chopsticks. I didn’t want to ruin my cooking thermometer so I didn’t measure how hot the dye got, but I’m guessing it was nowhere near boiling since I didn’t scratch my keys like others reported when things got close to the limit. To complicate things further, I live at elevation so water boils at a lower temperature (92c/200f instead of 100c/212f), so I couldn’t get it as hot as yall can at sea level anyway. Luckily, none of this seemed to matter in the end. Do not leave glass jar unattended, the boiling water bubbles might flip it.<br><img src="dye_in_boiling_water.jpg" alt=""></p></li></ol><h3 id="Put-the-caps-into-the-dye"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Put-the-caps-into-the-dye">&gt;</a>Put the caps into the dye</h3><ol><li><p>When the dye seems warm enough or has been sitting in the boiling water for a while, drop your keys in. Be sure you have a plan on how you’re going to get the keys out first, and if you made a dying plan, double check that you’re dying the correct keys. Start the stopwatch. Check the colours progress of the keys every 30-60 seconds. I did this by picking one out with chopsticks and rinsing it in the other container to check its true shade, and tossing it back in if needed. If you’re going for pastels, you may want to check more often as to not overshoot. The keys I made took 2-4 minutes to get to the desired shade. <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?PHPSESSID=30g7qr3cvifiqdhfnpu80mi5i9bnnl5f&amp;topic=35444.msg664178#msg664178">One experimenter’s chart</a> seems to show that colder temps for longer periods makes more pastel-like colours. In my experience the diluteness of the dye seemed to matter the most.</p></li><li><p>When the colour looks right, take all the keys out and dunk them in the rinsing container. I took them out with chopsticks individually, but you could also pour them out into a mesh drainer over the sink. I did not do this because I didn’t want to sacrifice the food-safety of a mesh drainer, and I didn’t want to dye my sink with hot dye. Do what feels right to you.<br><img src="removing_keycap_from_dye.jpg" alt=""></p></li><li><p>Once in the rinsing bowl, rub each key with gloved hand to get extra residue off. I’ve seen people running their keys under cold water, though the rinsing bowl worked fine for me. I noticed the keys get ever so slightly darker after being rinsed and sitting around to dry. Maybe it’s a trick of the light? If you want pastel keys, I would take them out of the dye when they’re slightly lighter than you want them.</p></li><li><p>Lightly dry keys with towel and place it on the corresponding positions on your dying plan paper. I liked doing this as I went through each colour so I could see the keys in context, in case I needed to darken the colours to get a better match.<br><img src="keycap_color_mapped.jpg" alt=""></p></li><li><p>Repeat with other key colour groups.</p></li><li><p>When you have all the keys dyed, inspect the gradient to see if there’s any corrections you want to make. You can only make keys darker at this point.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Results"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Results">&gt;</a>Results</h2><p>You did it! Make sure keycaps are completely dry before putting them back on the keyboard. Take a victorious photo. Take a selfie. Tell your friends about it.</p><p>Hot tip: wait until dyes are cooled before pouring down the drain. They’re more likely to stain when hot. I poured it down the bathtub drain because the hole is bigger.</p><p>Putting my face close to my newly dyed keys, I can definitely tell they are DIY. There are spots on the bottom or side of keycaps that don’t take colour at all or at the same rate as the rest of the surface, I am guessing it’s a relic from the manufacturing technique?</p><p><img src="imperfections_side.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="imperfections_back.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I also wish I had gotten a more sky blue rather than a dark blue, but that was the first colour I tried and now I know it was insufficiently dilute. The dyed keys look matte rather than shiny as ABS keys are, almost as if painted by watercolour, which is kind of neat if unorthodox.</p><p>Was it the best use of my time spending hours supervising a boiling pot? Maybe not. Was it relaxing as heck sitting in my front yard listening to podcasts? Heck yeah. Overall, the keyboard cuteness has increased. And it’s been a long time since I’ve let myself indulge in grotesquely unviable hobby ventures!</p>  <figure>      <img src="standing-desk.jpg" alt="Gradient keyboard finally at home on my makeshift standing desk.">      <figcaption>      Gradient keyboard finally at home on my makeshift standing desk.      </figcaption>  </figure><p>Okay so. How did it go for you?? I’m curious to hear your experiences and see your results. Is there a good dying resourced I missed? A piece of reddit lore overlooked? Let me know in the comments below, or on discord or twitter or something.</p><p>The nice thing about saving the extra dye power is that now I can dye more keys in the future.

(left to right) my housemates daiyi and Yelly, and my friend Stephanie (our first hike together!)</figcaption></figure><p>Some shenanigans at the start of the day. As we drive to the trailhead my friend Spot texts us that their home got broken into by a human over night and they were 30 minutes late to meet us. The decision-making and communication were rushed, so we end up starting without them a bit past 8am, thinking they would be fast and catch.</p><figure><p><img src="paiute-lake.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>It's hot!!

The humans sound worried, but I knew Spot is great at hiking!</p><p>At Paiute Pass we have a big view of the trail, and Yelly spies a white dot that could be a dog. Soon Spot is here, with his people Lucas and Jaymie close behind!</p><figure><p><img src="dingos.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>I greet Spot at Paiute Pass!!</figcaption></figure><p>The humans sound excited and relieved, and resolve to call each other to hash out specifics in the future. I don’t know how to use a phone, I’m a dog!</p><figure><p><img src="paiute-pass.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Crossing Paiute Pass, now a party of 5 people and 2 dingos</figcaption></figure><p>7 miles into the hike, Spot’s humans Jaymie and Lucas are ready to turn around. It’s been a rough morning for them with the break-in. We have a big group hug, I give Spot a goodbye lick, and we head northwest off the trail to start the big cross-country part of the day.</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="bye-spot.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Bye spot! bye Jaymie and Lucas <3</figcaption></figure></div><figure><p><img src="crosscountry.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Starting off cross-country. You can see Pilot Knob rising in the distance! about 4.25 miles away.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s super hot and my tongue is dragging on the floor. We pass by some streams on the map but they’re dry, because it’s late season. Luckily there’s a lot of little run-offs as we do the long, lumpy traverse of Humphreys Basin. I go for a swim every opportunity I can!</p><figure><p><img src="meadow-stream.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>I find a gross little stream and immediately get inside!</figcaption></figure><p>The humans find a running stream and fill up on water, treating with tablets.

Very hot!! no more water to jump into.</figcaption></figure><p>Stephanie is satisfied with how far she’s come, so she finds a shady rock to camp out under while the rest of us continue. daiyi gives her a foam sitting pad they found on the ground earlier!</p><figure><p><img src="stephanie-under-a-rock.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Stephanie waits for us in the best nook on the mountain.</figcaption></figure><p>The first part of the slopes is sandy scree and small talus, which is easy for dogs. The last hundred feet of gain to the top gets trickier. It’s definitely possible for a dog, but keeping it class 2 is not always obvious. I’m lucky to have daiyi and Yelly working together to help me find the best way up.</p><figure><p><img src="summit-ridge.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Once at the top, you have to traverse the ridge further than expected to find the official summit.</figcaption></figure><div class="photos"><figure><p><img src="register.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>We did it!

I’m panting up a storm and Yelly shares some of her funky tube water.</p><figure><p><img src="summit-selfie.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Summit selfie!</figcaption></figure><p>Our long day is only halfway done! The way down is much easier for me than the way up, because we drop on the slope earlier instead of following the ridge like we did on the way up. Soon we reunite with Stephanie, who looks very happily rested. Now we have 4 miles of cross-country back to the trail.</p><figure><p><img src="ridge-down.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Coming down the slopes together.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="meadow.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Yelly crossing a scenic stream and meadow.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="pond-again.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>It's nice to be off of Pilot Knob, where I can once again go swimming every chance I get! Gotta stay cool with prosthetic sweat.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="square-lake-redux.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>We're back at Square Lake, and this time humans go swimming too! Stephanie and daiyi take a cool dip. Yelly eats human kibbles (peanut M&Ms).</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="twins.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Twinning with our packs!</figcaption></figure><p>We’re all really feeling the small ups and downs on the remaining cross-country. Daiyi has had holes in their shoes for the last couple of hikes and it makes their soles sore. I’m a dog, I don’t wear shoes! My toe beans were definitely getting a little beat, I shed a bit of top skin and had some rubbing, but no lost toe nails or blisters :D</p><figure><p><img src="trail-YAY.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Great excitement finally getting back on the trail! 2 hours 40 min after leaving the summit. </figcaption></figure><p>Just 7 miles of Paiute Pass trail left, which goes by much quicker. I’m getting tired, and sticking to the heels of my human friends.</p><figure><p><img src="paiute-pass-pm.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Looking back into Humphreys Basin at Paiute Pass</figcaption></figure><p>Although I somehow still have energy to chase one last squirrel! I almost get it this time but it tricks me by standing very very still.</p><p>It’s much cooler now, but I still go for a swim in the ponds between Paiute Pass and Loch Leven.</p><figure><p><img src="dingo-roll.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>Doing my dingo roll after a swim in the lake.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="dusk.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Descending past Emerson and Paiute Crags, distant mountains glowing with dusk.</figcaption></figure><figure><p>We wind through the forest at sunset, and make it to the dirt road just as it’s too dark to see! No headlamps! It’s 8pm, which makes our dayhike a total of 12 hours. I jump into the EV and immediately curl up into a donut. We drive down to Bishop, and I inhale kibble and water in the car and go back to sleep while the humans meet up with Astro Ben at Mountain Rambler for dinner.</p><p>I’m totally passed out for the whole ride back to Mammoth.</p><figure><p><img src="dingo-slep.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Back home, I am v v sleepy.</figcaption></figure><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="leo-ice-cream.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Leo made more ice cream that I can't eat!</figcaption></figure></div><figure><p><img src="ding-still-slep.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The next day, I'm pretty beat and sleep on every surface in the house.</figcaption></figure><p>It was my longest hike yet for my 12th SPS! And then I slept for two whole days.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Compared to Cathedral (5.6) and Tenaya (5.5) (which are admittedly very differently styled climbs from one another and difficult to compare), I would want to simul and not solo those, but I would solo Emerson again.</p><p>On the other hand, I have heard the chimney is slick with water early-season, and have heard of very bad epics and accidents on this route from beginner climbers. Let’s just say I’m glad I did this after I was comfortable well above the grade, acclimated, and trail-running and cross-country slogging all summer, which kept my experience solidly in the type 1 fun category.</p><p>I don’t own approach shoes, so I wore oversized climbing shoes the entire way to the summit.

There’s no obvious route, aside from finding the most solid rock possible. We passed a party of 2, and scrambled up a different way than they did.</p><p>At one point I knocked off a small rock, which hit my hand as it tumbled down the slope. I didn’t yell “rock!” as quickly as I could have. That small rock triggered loose rocks to slide, which caused a large rock to glance off the shoulder of one of the other party, who was directly below us at this point. We yelled if everyone was ok, and it sounded like the person hit by the rock was upset and had a sore shoulder, but was otherwise able to continue. Pretty spooky.</p><p>If this climb were 10 miles further into the backcountry then I’d say the route is solid and safe for small parties that are communicating, but since it’s just an hour or two from the road, the chance of multiple parties is high, and that makes rockfall a serious issue ):</p><figure><p><img src="ridge-start.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>After the scrambling up the gully.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="Ridge"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Ridge">&gt;</a>Ridge</h3><figure><p><img src="ridge-up.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Headed around a gendarme, up to the ridge.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="paiute-crags.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Geological view of the Paiute crags to climber's right (east).</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="ridge-paiute.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>At the start of the ridge!</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="ridge-traverse.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Traversing the ridge.

Since hiking <a href="/blog/Mount-Davis">Mount Davis</a> last year and catching a glimpse of the peaks past Ritter and Banner, I was keen to go to the more remote parts of the Sierra, and Rodgers was nestled nicely between the Ritter Range and Yosemite, two places I like a lot.</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="start.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Pre-dawn start at 5:15am. I was planning to meet Rafee at Marie Lakes, 12 miles in, getting a head start in case I felt slow that day. In retrospect totally unnecessary.</figcaption></figure></div><figure><p><img src="dawn.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Dawn over June Lake, 45 minutes into my hike (:</figcaption></figure><p>That morning was unexpectedly chilly (low 40s F?). In combination with walking briskly up the trail, and yarding on my hiking poles which cut the circulation from my hands, I had a couple minutes on the verge of <a href="https://gripped.com/profiles/screaming-barfies-why-and-how-to-avoid">screaming barfies</a>. Painful! Maybe liner gloves next time.</p><p>I was suprised to learn that all these lakes above June are dammed!</p><div class="photos"><figure><p><img src="agnew-dam.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The dam at Agnew Lake</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="gem.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Gem Lake, also dammed</figcaption></figure></div><figure><p><img src="waugh.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>Waugh Lake, also also dammed! Not much water left here. My housemate who <a href="https://www.peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=1740989">climbed Rodgers</a> 2.5 weeks later said it was completely dry.</p></figcaption></figure><p>I spent a brief couple of miliseconds crossing the JMT, where a ranger who saw me in my getup and said “have a nice run!”.</p><p>I passed a mule team at Rush Creek, the namesake of the trailhead, and one of the guides told me they had an entire kitchen packed up for their clients.</p><figure><p><img src="mules.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Mules ladden with kitchen gear at Rush Creek.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="rush-creek.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Rush Creek from further up the trail. The fire smoke forecasted for the evening is already coming in.</figcaption></figure><p>After 4 hours 15 min I was at the first Marie Lake, where the trail tapers off. Rafee said he’d be there at 10am, so I was glad to have half an hour to splash around the lake, lay in the sun to dry off, and eat my first lunch :D</p><figure><p><img src="marie-lakes.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The lower Marie Lake, where I took a swim break.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="sando.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>First lunch at 9:30am :D</figcaption></figure><p>At 10:30, half an hour past our meeting time, Rafee is nowhere to be seen. I’m low key wondering if he’d somehow passed me without either of us noticing. Then it’s 11am, an hour past our meeting time, and I’m wondering if Rafee is ok. I notice I have a tiny bit of cell signal, and I text my housemates that I was thinking about turning back because Rafee is missing. My housemate Yelly checks Rafee’s inreach tracks and tells me that he’s on his way, so I nap on a warm slab. Soon enough, Rafee arrives at the lake! He has a friend with him.</p><figure><p><img src="rafee-is-alive.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Company arrives</figcaption></figure><p>We circle the lake counterclockwise and head to upper Marie Lakes along a stream. With company, my stoke for a long dayhike returns and I’m feeling energised!</p><figure><p><img src="waterfall.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Waterfall on the way to upper Marie Lakes</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="marie-lakes-upper.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Fetching fresh water and snacking up at upper Marie Lakes</figcaption></figure><p>The next part is the most involved bit of backcountry. There’s some slab and talus slopes to a ridge, and eventually this sideways traversal of a loose scree and talus slope:</p><figure><p><img src="slopes.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Looks improbable, but not too bad. The furthest peak is the summit of Rodgers.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="rafee-scramble.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Rafee scrambling up to the class 3 ridge.</figcaption></figure><p>On the way up, I stick to the ridge, which is up to class 3 with cool exposure at times. This could be kept mostly class 2 and goes slightly faster by continuing to conture lower on the slopes instead, which is how I did it on the way down. Overall I felt that it’s a lot more straightforward and less tedius than other peaks. It’s not great for dogs, so I’m glad Mica didn’t come along this time.</p><figure><p><img src="talus.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Rafee leaves the ridge and begins the last 500 vertical feet of easy talus to the summit.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="succulent.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>A high altitude succulent friend at 12,400 ft.

I could barely make out the snow Y-shape on <a href="/blog/Red-Slate-Mountain">Red Slate Mountain</a> through the smoke.</p></figcaption></figure><p>It’s hard to wrap my head around, but Yosemite Valley is somehow directly west of us, and I could see straight to Half Dome.</p><figure><p><img src="summit-yos.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Summit selfie west, with Yosemite, where the smoke seems worse. I could barely see Half Dome, and my camera could not at all ):</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="lyell-mcclure.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Also to the Yosemite side and seeming deceptively close are Maclure (12,880 ft) and Lyell (13,114 ft, tallest peak in Yosemite).</figcaption></figure><p>I chill at the top snacking and reading the summit register for a pretty long time, maybe 50 minutes, which is bold consider how much hiking there was left to do! There were only a handful of parties to sign this year, and the notebook had dates back to the 70s.</p><figure><p><img src="sierra-challengers.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Ran into other Sierra Challenge people on the way down, they were going up to their second peak!</figcaption></figure><p>I felt like the descent to Marie Lakes went pretty quickly and uneventfully, except for one loose block I pulled out that hit my finger and made it bleed. Scrambling is no joke.</p><figure><p><img src="marie-lakes-redux.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Back to lower Marie Lakes, which had serious Thousand Island Lakes vibes going on at this hour.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="rafee-snack.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Rafee snacking up at Marie Lakes. Good job Rafee! We all went for a swim here too, it was EXTREMELY refreshing and I felt very alive.</figcaption></figure><p>The conversation was getting kind of bro-y and I was longing for solitude, so I jogged ahead when we hit the trail. I descended into a dense smog.</p><figure><p><img src="waugh-smoke.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Waugh Lake, but smokey</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="smoke-af.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Gem Lake rocking that Mad Max post-apocalyptic vibe.</figcaption></figure><p>There were a lot of small ups and downs along the lakes, which I’d forgotten about, and I really felt it while jogging out. I startled a resting backpacking at a log crossing, who was surprised dayhikers were still out so late, asking if I had a headlamp. I did have one! but the goal was not to use it (again) :P</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="rails.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The forbidden rail. The June Lake peaks are almost invisible due to smoke.</figcaption></figure></div><figure><p><img src="van.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Blessed Vanna awaits me at the trailhead.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally I reached the van at nearly 20:30, right as it got too dark to see the path. I was really nauseous and could barely sit up, my skin was flushed like I had a fever, and I felt hot and cold at the same time. My first thought was did I get COVID?? and then I suspected the 9 mile jog in bad air. I pulled my face close to the filtered van fans to breathe the good stuff.</p><p>I was actually barely holding it together those last couple of miles, but the thought of 5 pints of ice cream and leftover curry kept me going. Now I felt too sick to enjoy ice cream, but I heated up the curry and forced myself to eat. I was in no condition to drive, so I slept where I was parked, just a half hour from my house. The next morning I drove out at an equally smokey sunrise and was really shocked to see people on the streets running and cycling as if nothing was wrong. The smoke remained bad through that week, so this was my first and last Sierra Challenge for the year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In late July, my sister moved from California to Washington State to start a new life. As a long-time fan of interstitial opportunities for goofing off, I proposed making a van trip out of it. I usually make a beeline towards Seattle or Squamish when I do this drive and miss most of the Pacific Northwest, only stopping at Bend/Smith Rock to climb.</p><p>Our roadtrip vibes this time was different: we wanted to go with the flow, see what we could see, and let serendipity take the wheel. It was a heat wave, so the cooling rivers, waterfalls, and lakes were much more appealing than my usual desire to be on a rock or peak.</p><h3 id="Did-you-know-you-can-just-drive-into-a-watermelon-patch"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Did-you-know-you-can-just-drive-into-a-watermelon-patch">&gt;</a>Did you know you can just drive into a watermelon patch?</h3><p>True to our mission of spontaneity, I was already detouring off the 5 just 1.5 hours out of the Bay Area to follow a series of watermelon emoji signs, which is not what you do if you want to get to Seattle as fast as possible.</p><figure><p><img src="scale.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Traffic at the u-pick watermelon truck scale?</figcaption></figure><p>In a big open lot, the person at the kiosk waved me onto a truck scale (!!) and weighted the van, then gave verbal instructions on how to get to the watermelon patch, which you <em>drive your entire car into</em>! There was a little Prius there, and a gloved person furiously tossing melons into the trunk, clearly an expert. It was nearly 100f with a dry breeze. This is a class of fruit I never considered recreationally harvesting.</p><figure><p><img src="watermelon-vanna.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>"How did I get here?"</figcaption></figure><p>We googled “how to pick a watermelon”, walked around the patch in flip flops, and selected one (1) juicy boy.</p><div class="photos"><figure><p><img src="watermelon-meimei.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="watermelon.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Back at the truck scale, the kiosk person was shocked that a vehicle of such massive watermelon capacity only weighted one (1) watermelon more than before. She said it was common for Bay Area folk to load up and resell at farmer’s markets.</p><p>We’re supposed to rinse these real good before eating, so we bathed it in a nearby rest stop. It was actually the most flavourful and juicy watermelon I have ever tasted, and all grocery store watermelon since have turned to ash in my mouth, so be aware of the consequences if you want to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/n9E2ZctH372fXzTi9">pick your own watermelon</a>.</p><div class="photos"><figure><p><img src="watermelon-bath.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="watermelon-cut.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="Fire-comes-early-to-NorCal"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Fire-comes-early-to-NorCal">&gt;</a>Fire comes early to NorCal</h3><p>As a seasoned Californian, I’m well aware of the phenomenon where fire season doesn’t exist until oh fuck oh fuck your personal sky zone goes dark with smoke. The <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2021/7/14/dixie-fire">Dixie fire</a> had been going on for a week and a half already but we were surprised to descend into a thick smog at Shasta Lake, the forested hills barely visible along the winding highway. We woke up at Lake Siskiyou in a plume, the famous views of Mount Shasta casually wiped from the sky.</p><figure><p><img src="lake-siskiyou.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Smoke and orange light at Lake Siskiyou. Welcome to summer in California.</figcaption></figure><p>That didn’t put us in the mood to paddle like we’d planned, but it was hot and we drove out east towards McCloud, hoping to be enticed to splash around under waterfalls. It was still hazy at the trailhead, but the stoke was rising. I packed sourdough avocado sandwiches, and we made the quick stroll down to Upper McCloud Falls, skied down the steep dirt slope, and took a VERY cold snow-melt dip! My butt went numb as I swam to the other side of the pool but it felt AMAZING. We scrambled around to the base of the falls where it was powerfully loud, felt the air rushing out, observed the hanging garden of greens clinging to the cracks and ledges in the basalt wall. Sat on a rock and ate a sandwich.</p><figure><p><img src="mccloud-falls.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Upper McCloud Falls, cold and refreshing.</figcaption></figure><p>Heading back through McCloud to get back on the 5 North, we stopped in town for coffee. It was unexpectedly empty, and the barista was surprised we didn’t know about the world-famous <a href="https://discoversiskiyou.com/events/74th-annual-lumberjack-fiesta">74th Annual Lumberjack Fiesta</a> that was going on down the street at Hoo Hoo Park.</p><h3 id="A-three-watersport-day-in-Central-Oregon"><a class="header-anchor" href="#A-three-watersport-day-in-Central-Oregon">&gt;</a>A three-watersport day in Central Oregon</h3><p>It was approaching 100f on the highway. The fire smoke was thickening, and the AC was working hard. Fun mini game: Mercedes makes a “safety feature” that automatically switches off internal air circulation, so I had to catch the sharp inhalation sound of the van trying to take a big gulp of smoke air and mash the internal circulation button every dozen of minutes.</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="crater-lake.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>I wanted to make a detour to visit the famously clear water of Crater Lake, but after seeing this <a href="https://www.nps.gov/media/webcam/view.htm?id=88F5EE0B-04BA-2C9C-83226089ADFC8005">webcam</a> footage we decided against it.</p></figcaption></figure></div><p>I kept driving until the air cleared up, so we were already in the Deschutes in Central Oregon that night. We caught up on our respective PT exercises before bed, so I was doing crabwalks with a resistance band to the sound of screaming ducks and water birds.</p><figure><p><img src="deschutes.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>An otherwise quiet camp spot, minus the screaming birds.</figcaption></figure><p>Waking up early, I started driving up the scenic loop through the Deschutes, turning off at a sign for Osprey Point Interpretive Site. We were excited for opportunistic birdwatching and I wanted to see an osprey, but were defeated by a sudden and impenetrable wall of mosquitos that slapped us in a solid wave by the water. Right, this is Oregon. Nursing our bites and wounds, we try again at Lava Lake and found it significantly less bugful.</p><figure><p><img src="lava-lake.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Lava Lake, calm with a bit of drizzle. Peaks left to right: South Sister, Broken Top, Mt Bachelor.</figcaption></figure><p>It quietly rained a bit while we were paddling on the water, which for a Californian was a mystical experience. By the afternoon it was hot again, and we were feeling a swim. Oregon is like a waterpark and there are infinite lakes, but I thought it’d be nice to find a smaller one that didn’t have a road sticking out of it. We did a little trek out to Blow Lake. That water was so clear! and there was shockingly no one else there. Even more surprising, it was apoparently late-season enough that there were no mosquitos. We had the whole lake to ourselves. It felt amazing. I sat on a rock and dried off in the sun. I want to live this day every week.</p><figure><p><img src="blow-lake.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Blow Lake, like a dream.</figcaption></figure><p>Heading to town, we rolled into Bend with enough time to do <a href="https://www.visitbend.com/things-to-do/activities/river-lake-water/deschutes-river-floating-tubing">a float</a>! I didn’t want to mess around with the <a href="http://cascadeseasttransit.com/ride/ride-the-river">bus shuttle</a> with COVID, so I made my own shuttle: I dropped the paddleboard and my sister off at the south end of the float (Riverbend Park), parked the car in the middle (Bend Whitewater Park), and jogged back to my sister (less than a mile, which took 10 minutes). I don’t have a photo I want to share but it was as nice as I had remembered from my last float in 2019, there’s a reason it’s a classic (:</p><figure><p><img src="sunset.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Found a corral of vans outside of town and watched the sunset with the other campers.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="Smith-Rock"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Smith-Rock">&gt;</a>Smith Rock</h3><p>This is the first time I’ve been out to Smith Rock and didn’t climb. It was actually pouring rain that morning in Bend, so we drove north after eating an Ocean Roll at <a href="https://www.thesparrowbakery.net">Sparrow Bakery</a>, which was covered in unapologetically desperate hiring flyers like every food business in 2021. It was still raining on and off as we hiked the Misery Ridge in Smith, which was made actually pleasant by the cold breeze. Rounding the river, I saw some folks toproping on moderate routes, so perhaps the locals are less shy about wet rock than me.</p><figure><p><img src="monkeyface.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>This looks so much more like a Monkey Face from the hiker’s angle than when you’re <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105791048/monkey-face">climbing</a> up the long snakey neck.</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id="Mt-Hood"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Mt-Hood">&gt;</a>Mt Hood</h3><p>Continuing north, the road carves up Utah-like tablelands and then the forest thickens. I spy Mt Hood, and I realise this might be the first time I looked at it on purpose, and somehow all the other times it must have been too dark or I was asleep in the passenger seat. It’s a pretty striking volcano! We find a camp spot at Trillium Lake with a view of the big boy.</p><figure><p><img src="hood-evening.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Dinner under Mt Hood</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="hood-morning.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Breakfast under Mt Hood</figcaption></figure><p>Watching Mt Hood while eating a pasta dinner, we see some ospreys flying by, completing our failed Osprey Point sidequest from earlier. A neighboring van traveller was excited to see us with crash pads, but we were just using it in couch mode to picnic on :^)</p><p>We went forth onto Hood itself, and from Timberline Lodge, we hike a bit north on the PCT. I was in running shorts and a tank top. People geared up in goggles, buff, and waterproof pants booted past me with skis and snowboards on their shoulders. There was a line to descend the dirty patch of ice sitting on the slopes in late July. Surreal AF.</p><figure><p><img src="ski.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>I wouldn't want to ski that??</figcaption></figure><p>The hike down to Zigzag river was nice, but there was an increasing amount of flies that wanted to land and hang out on my body and I found that to be a uniquely unpleasant experience! I didn’t even know it was possible to have an emotional reaction to flies overload, maybe it’s a Pacific Northwest thing?</p><figure><p><img src="sando.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Representative sourdough avocado sando that we've been packing every day for lunch. Zigzag river in the back.</figcaption></figure><p>Heading north again, I turned off the highway at the town of Mt Hood when I saw a farmer’s market sign. We scored a hand pie, heirloom tomatoes, cherries, and peaches.</p><figure><p><img src="farmer-coop.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Front row seat at the Farmer's Market.</figcaption></figure><p>We drove through Hood River, still days away from learning that it’s a meca for windsurfing, heading west along the Columbia River Gorge. There’s some interesting geological stuff going on here, it is a hotspot for waterfalls. Before leaving Oregon, we wanted to check out one more. We took an evening hike to Devil’s Punchbowl as the sun was setting, but it was VERY hot. An older person on a bike rolled by picking up trash with a little claw as I got ready in the parking lot. She said she was the host of the campgrounds up the street. We couldn’t figure out how to get inside the punchbowl, just looked at it from above, then went for a very glorious swim/bath in the river at Lower Punchbowl.</p><div class="photos"><figure><p><img src="punchbowl.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Devil's Punchbowl</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="eagle-creek-trail.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>A little via ferrata on the way.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I was too tired to find a van bivvy so we went to those nearby campgrounds, where I cooked a soba dinner while my sister counted out $15 of camping fee in mostly quarters (had spent our paper cash at the farmer’s market!)</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="mac.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The best part of traveling in a van is the freezer. We had daily ice cream</figcaption></figure></div><p>The next day we were already going all the way to Seattle. When I drove back home through Oregon the following week, I couldn’t see Mt Hood through the fire smoke, and it was too smoggy in Bend to bag a volcano. We were lucky to have had our trip the week before.</p><figure><p><img src="dip.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded>

This road is impassible and the public is asked to refrain driving on the road until repairs are made.</p></blockquote><p>So that you are emotionally prepared, know that you might have to start your hike more than 4 miles before the trailhead listed on hiking websites. There are 9 miles round-trip of washed out driving to and from the true trailhead (9,895’) of Bloody Mountain. This isn’t an ordinary dirt road, it’s real 4x4/high clearance with 3-foot chasms and requires a capable vehicle and capable driver. My <a href="https://www.peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=1454752">housemates did it</a> with their truck in August 2020 and said it was an hour each way. We opted instead to walk from the very start of the road (7,320’), which took 1.5 hours each way. Between 2 hour of internally screaming in a car, or 3 hours of uneventful walking, I thought the extra hour of walking was fine :'D</p><figure><p><img src="road-conditions.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Class 4 for cars, but Class 1 for dogs.

Many people fishing here.</figcaption></figure><p>After Crystal Lake, you go left onto some use trails. Climbers keep going left to the base of North Arete (5.6/5.8), but dingos cut across right over a bit of talus to the base of the west side of the peak, which is the descent for the climb.</p><figure><p><img src="snow.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Obligatory roll in the last remaints of snow.</figcaption></figure><p>Some parts of the west face can be loose, and sometimes there’s a LOT of climbers coming down, so a helmet is not a bad idea.</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="waiting.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Waiting at the base for a party of climbers to scramble down the descent.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I needed some spotting to get off the ground, but then there was some dingo-friendly terrain.</p><figure><p><img src="going-up.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The first part of the scramble goes up friendly class 2 ledges and slab.</figcaption></figure><p>We managed to get to the saddle before it got rough for dogs.

(Can you see me waiting on the ridge?). Photo points north. To the left is Crystal Lake; to the right you can see all the lakes of Lakes Basin.</figcaption></figure><p>Descending proved to be a trial. It can be spooky going down face-first, so I was hesitant at times. It was getting stressful for everyone involved so for the first time I got put into the backpack (as rehersed at home) to enjoy the ride for the trickiest bits of descent.</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="mica-bag.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Getting shoved into a backpack is aid. Not my most ding-nified moment.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We made it to the ground safely! and the clouds cleared up as we strolled back to the car. Will I ever learn to climb class 3? Will I grow thumbs and be allowed into Yosemite? Tune in next time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mount Davis is an unremarkable lump of rotten talus overshadowed by the iconic peaks Ritter and Banner to the southeast, its redeeming qualities being the vast summit views of the classic peaks surrounding it, and its membership on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Peaks_Section#SPS_List">SPS list</a>.</p><h3 id="Route-Overview"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Route-Overview">&gt;</a>Route Overview</h3><p>The day starts with a distressingly gentle 9-mile hike on a superhighway trail from Agnew Meadows to Thousand Island Lake, followed by intermittent use trails up a grassy slope along a stream (last water refill unless you want to descend to Lake Catherine) then talus to North Glacier Pass, and finally infinite class 2 talus forever to the summit. From North Glacier Pass there are 3.5-4 miles roundtrip of talus (depending on if you take the ridge or go around it), which is almost too much talus. There’s the kind of boulder field you can gleefully bounce across, and this was not it. Nonetheless, we thought it was a pretty average Sierra summit slog (disclaimer: the party consisted of three suffer-seeking individuals calibrated for long days of cardio/physical pain. An ordinary person would potentially resent this hike). The total was 27+ miles, 14 hours car-to-car. It’s all about the journey, right? Thousand Island Lake alone could make the day, that place is <em>magical</em>, and Lake Catherine was <em>so blue</em>.</p><a href="map.png"><p><img src="map.png" alt="map of route"></a></p><p>For the adventurous, it looks like there’s a more direct route from the east, but we found very little information on it aside from these <a href="https://peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=1273443">unannotated tracks</a> from a reputedly hardcore peakbagger, and <a href="https://www.summitpost.org/mount-davis/153527">a sentence on Summit Post</a> about its 4th class nature. From the top it looked loose, with snow patches, so we begrudgingly descended the way we came.</p><h3 id="So-how-was-your-day"><a class="header-anchor" href="#So-how-was-your-day">&gt;</a>So how was your day?</h3><p>My buddy Phil had dutifully taken a COVID test and driven in from the city to embark on a 3-day backpacking trip with me, but the smoke from the Bay Area lightning fires arrived at Mammoth the same day he and his little Vanagon did, so we resigned ourselves to a lost weekend. Miraculously the smoke looked like it was clearing Friday night, and we managed to salvage our holiday by jumping aboard Yelly’s Saturday dayhike. Mica’s foot was still swollen, so she had to stay behind ):</p><p>We arrived to the Agnew Meadows parking lot at 6:30am, where there was already no parking! probably because the shuttle wasn’t running this year due to COVID.</p><p>The first 8 miles were a mellow stroll in the woods that flew by with pleasant company and conversation. We spotted a bear and cubs at the bottom of the valley, and then a frazzled NPC who had gotten separated from his family in the dark last night and had camped alone. He was extremely enthusiastic about a pool he had found that we <em>had</em> to go swim in right that minute (we declined the side-quest).</p><p>As we neared Thousand Island Lake, we got our first glimpse of Banner Peak:</p><p><img src="first-sighting-of-banner.jpg" alt="Banner Peak from Thousand Island Lake"></p><p>There was a curtain of haze in the air, but the mountain was definitely visible!</p><p>As we descended to Thousand Island Lake, the ridge to the summit came into view, although we weren’t sure which one it would be at the time:</p><p><img src="1000-island-lake-and-crest.jpg" alt="Thousand Island Lake and the crest to Mount Davis"></p><p>We left the lake at the west end of Thousand Island and started up the slope. Intermittent use trails follow the Middle Fork San Joaquin River until the river peels off west to its snowfield origins, while we continued south-ish up the gully.</p><div class="photos"><div class="photo"><figure><p><img src="water-source.jpg" alt="stream crossing"></p><figcaption>Last water refill (unless you want to descend to Catherine Lake),</figcaption></figure></div><div class="photo"><figure><p><img src="to-north-glacier-pass.jpg" alt="north glacier pass"></p><figcaption>followed by talus up to North Glacier Pass.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>At the pass we saw Lake Catherine, it had the bluest water. The wind got pretty intense here and was intense for the next mile.</p><p>From here we had the option of going straight up and along the ridge, or skirting around. We tried going up directly, but we stopped after 300 vertical feet because it was terrible and loose, and we starting traversing left and up instead. The next mile of talus sucked. Somehow I had expected there to be sand on the backside of the ridge (maybe because I climbed Conness recently), but it was ENTIRELY talus.</p><div class="photo-section"><div class="photo-left-pull"><figure><p><img src="talus-to-summit.jpg" alt="looking at towards the summit"></p><figcaption>Mount Davis is the white/red lump in the distance.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Then we crested a local maxima and could finally see Mount Davis. We scooted down this snow patch into the gully below, which had easier terrain.</p><p>I pulled something on the top of my right foot, which hurt with a shooting pain when my foot was angled up ): I actually considered stopping here because of that and the uninspiring terrain, but Yelly was feeling optimistic. Shockingly, the talus was less terrible from here, and two more soft low-angled snow traversals helped cover distance.</p></div><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="summit-ahead.jpg" alt="under the summit"></p><figcaption>Nearing the photogenic summit of Mount Davis.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="summitting.jpg" alt="at the summit"></p><figcaption>Coming up to the summit, Thousand Island Lake down below.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We’re at the top! It’s 13:50. I inhaled a burrito. We updated Leo (who had been waiting for hours at Thousand Island Lake to meet us for the hike back) on the realities of our dramatically over-optimistic schedule, and he headed out without us.</p><p>We played the peak identification game, and it was getting hazier with incoming smoke even as we sat there. I was amazed at how close Lyell looked, and felt inspired to climb it :D</p><p>After the ritual summit selfies, we started down.</p><h4 id="Time-to-Descend"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Time-to-Descend">&gt;</a>Time to Descend</h4><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="talus-going-back.jpg" alt="descending talus"></p><figcaption>Look at all of this talus we crossed. And now we go back.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="photo-section"><div class="photo-right-pull"><p><img src="talus.jpg" alt="talus gully"></p></div><p>We took a slightly different way down, I descended a chute and went further west, where I was met with gentle slab (which could be scary with the wrong shoes). I had decided to wear my new Altras (King MT 2) on this hike, and I found the rubber to be sufficiently sticky (noticably not as good as actual approach shoes, but better than any other trailrunner I’ve had).</p></div><figure><p><img src="catherine-pan.jpg" alt="Lake Catherine"></p><figcaption>Lake Catherine being extremely blue, and the less dignified backsides of Banner (left) and Ritter (right).</figcaption></figure><div class="photo-section"><div class="photo-left-pull photo-small"><figure><p><img src="meadow-back.jpg" alt="meadow"></p><figcaption><p>The talus is over, I can finally turn off my brain!</p></figcaption></figure></div><p><br><br><br></p><p>There was a woop of joy when we reached the meadow at the end of the talus. We refilled water for the last time before hitting the extremely crowded shores of Thousand Island Lake, now swelling with Saturday evening backpackers and their cute pups. I stepped over a tent stake driven literally into the middle of the trail (??).</p><p>We passed a pair of rangers with shovels, which they said was for <em>burying human poop</em>. Do people…not do that??</p></div><p>The islands in the lake had a sunset glow. Me and Phil dunked our sticky bodies into the water, it was as glorious as I’d dreamed of all day.</p><p><img src="thousand-island-lake-evening.jpg" alt="Thousand Island Lake at sunset"></p><p>The smoke got noticably worse on the hike back, by the last couple miles I felt like I was going to crash a BBQ at any minute. Our spirits remained mysteriously high, even when we started hallucinating bears. Night fell, but we were rich in headlamps and made it to the truck without incident at 20:45. When we got home 20 minutes later, Marco had dinner ready!</p><p>That was a long day and I’m happy to say that we didn’t scare Phil off from hiking with us :D</p><p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://mountains.ayeletbitton.com">yelly</a> and <a href="http://philipnr.mn">phil</a> for supplimentary photos \o/</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Having started up the mountain and turned around 4 years ago because it was so boring, Yelly warned me that it would be a boring day. But if there’s anything a dog is good at, it is finding a way to not be bored.</p><a href="map.png"><p><img src="map.png" alt="how we went up mount warren"><br></a></p><p>When Yelly got into the adventure truck that morning I jumped right into the copilot seat, because I know this machine to be a magical portal to interesting places. We headed towards Tuolumne but stopped before we got there. I have <em>still</em> never been to Yosemite, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/pets.htm">I wonder why no one will bring me</a>?</p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="car.jpg" alt=""></p></div><p>There were plenty of trees at the start of the hike for squirrels to live in, I kept my nose peeled for juicy rodents. Yelly called me a lot in the beginning, but after a while we relaxed into a routine of me going out to scout and Yelly reliably following my lead.</p><p>We passed through some delicious mountain water streams. Yelly kept splashing me!</p><div class="photo-right-pull"><p><img src="forest.jpg" alt=""></p></div><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="stream.jpg" alt=""></p></div><p>Soon the tall grass came to an end and we entered the talus zone.</p><p><img src="talus-boundary.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Yelly stopped us for breaks occasionally, like humans tend to do. Dogs don’t really take breaks, but I would occasionally keep her company (especially since it meant I would recieve food).</p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="take-a-break.jpg" alt=""></p></div><p>The talus field seemed to go forever into the distance, perhaps the entire mountain was a pile of talus. The sun was hot, and Yelly offered me a lot of water, even when I wasn’t thirsty. When I didn’t drink, she dumped the water on my back!</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="drinking.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>Do I have to??</p></figcaption></figure></div><p>Finally the talus gully brought us to a delightful detour: snow! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermelon_snow">watermelon flavoured</a> this time. I love snow, it is the ideal playground to dig and wriggle in with little consequence, although I have basically an infinite pain tolerance anyway.</p><video controls autoplay loop><source src="mica-snow.webm" type="video/webm"></video><p>I would be happy to play in the snow all day, but we had to continue to the summit. I found the register! This is my third <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Peaks_Section#SPS_List">SPS</a>. There was a big view of Mono Lake below, and Yosemite which I can look at but not walk on(?)</p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="summit.jpg" alt=""></p></div><div class="photo-section"><div class="photo-right-pull"><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="summit-selfie.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption><p>Summit selfie with my BFF Yelly!</p></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>We relaxed at the summit as Yelly ate snacks and video called Leo, and I checked out the solar-paneled weather station that had seen better days.</p><div class="photo-inline"><p><img src="views.jpg" alt=""></p></div></div><p>The clouds rolled in for our descent, and Yelly finally stopped splashing me with water. I ran ahead but checked back occasionally to see that she was still following me. That was a great day!</p><p><img src="descent.jpg" alt=""></p><p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://ayeletbitton.com">yelly</a> for the photos.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In these weird COVID times, the leadership at my job decided there should be at least one company-wide 3-day weekend per month, and if the federal holiday calendar didn’t provide, they would manufacture it. In search of a partner for my random Friday off in August, I hit up my teacher-friend still enjoying the remains of summer break.</p><p><img src="start.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Alicia and I both kind of fell off the emotional and physical training wagon when the pandemic hit and aren’t at peak strength, so we picked something more leggy with a focus on having fun. And it was really fun! I’m actually glad I procrastinated on doing this climb until I was OP for the grade (5.6) so we were able to simul/solo it in a timely style rather than laboriously pitching out the entire thing. Highly recommend this strategy and this route, it is a classic for a reason \o/</p><ul><li>Gear: mostly single rack (including offset aliens, alicia’s favs), not enough slings, 40m skinny rope (from a double). We folded the 40 in half and used it as a 20m double for simuling. So light!</li><li>Approach: 4hr, 6am start</li><li>Climb: 3.5hr</li><li>Descent: 2.5hr</li><li>car-to-car: 11hr</li></ul><a href="conness-west-ridge-map.png"><p><img src="conness-west-ridge-map.png" alt="route map for west ridge of conness"><br></a></p><p>When I was looking for approach beta from Saddlebag Lake, both <a href="http://www.supertopo.com/packs/highsierra.html">supertopo</a> and <a href="http://maximuspress.com/shop/proddetail.php?prod=GGA">Croft</a>’s tracks went straight up the east ridge, but my speedy housemate <a href="lfranchi.com">Leo</a> and Alicia had both previously approached by the southern ridge. We went with that. I thought it was a mostly straightforward (no snow this year) with easy terrain, although my baseline for comparison is <a href="/blog/North-Arete-of-Bear-Creek-Spire/" title="Bear Creek Spire">Bear Creek Spire</a> from the previous week. The funny thing about this approach is that you hike up until you’re NEARLY at the summit, and then go through a notch and drop all the way down to the bottom of the west ridge. We messed that part up and accidentally continued towards the summit. I’ve heard from a bunch of people who are pretty capable at routefinding that this approach tripped them up, and I could see why one of the guidebook’s approach beta includes “go with someone who has done it before”.</p><div class="photo-section">  <div class="photo-right-pull"><p><img src="step-across.jpg" alt=""></p>  </div><p>Once we started climbing I didn’t really take photos because we were on the move constantly! I don’t think photos could capture the really cool exposure and breath-sucking knife’s-edge anyway, you have to go see for yourself :D We simuled the first bit, soloed for a while, then roped up for the last pitch as I got lightheaded from forgetting to snack up. Alicia continually checked in on how I was doing since I was the less experienced of us, she didn’t want to pressure me past my risk tolerance. That’s a good alpine partner!</p></div><p><img src="upper-ridge.jpg" alt="soloing near the top"></p><p>Halfway up the wind kicked in and the clouds condensed in that sudden lurch as it happens in the Sierra, as NOAA’s 10% forecast of afternoon thunderstorms manifested as reality. We felt droplets as we signed the summit register and started down the trail to distance ourselves from the incredibly lightning-vulnerable peak before eating our lunch burritos.</p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="summit-burrito.jpg" alt="summit burrito"></div></p><p>Of course with my luck this summer, the hail came down and was whipped across my face and neck by the wind. I didn’t bother getting my windshell out (I didn’t bring a rainshell), trotting down the ridge slopes while hiding in my sunshirt hood. The sandy trail smelled like wet pavement. The sun taunted us from the adjacent valley.</p><p><img src="valley.jpg" alt="valley"></p><p>The rest of the hike was on-and-off showers as we descended back into the green valley, and we were back at the car at 17:00 and home before 18:00. Though we’ve been in the same covid circle since march, Alicia had just traveled and was self-quarantining, so we masked up to carpool. The sun was out in Mammoth, Mica licked my toes at the door, and Yelly made a delicious dinner. I felt like the luckiest person ☀️</p><p><em>Edited: 2020-08-10</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was surprised when Marco’s idea for “what do you want to do this weekend” involved more than a 20 minute stroll, and even more so when he agreed to a 4am wakeup after I heard stories of friends epic-ing on this climb after getting off-route. We managed it car-to-car (c2c) in 14+ hours, 5:10 - 19:25. Great granite with improbably friendly climbing, neat ridge traversing, sweeping views, amazing weather, and a sloggy but safe descent made a good Sunday run in the mountains.</p><p>Gear: single rack to 2’, large nuts, a duck, many slings, 60m alpine rope.</p><p><img src="ridge-simul.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Here is a map of our approach. It isn’t a gps track, I drew it with digital marker, so it’s useless trying to follow it to the pixel, but I thought it was pretty straightforward to determine irl. We followed <a href="http://maximuspress.com/shop/proddetail.php?prod=GGA">Croft</a>’s approach of leaving the main trail at Gem Lakes, which seemed easy enough, although I did see <a href="https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=2669">Peakbagger</a> tracks that left earlier at Long Lake.</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="bear-creek-spire-map.png" alt="bear creek spire approach map"></p><figcaption><p>thanks for being a great map tool <a href="https://caltopo.com">caltopo</a>.</p></figcaption></figure></div><p>We left the house in Mammoth at 4:10, starting off the Mosquito Flat trailhead at the end of Rock Creek at 5:10 as the light came in and made my sleepy mind’s eye feel like I was walking in a claymation.</p><p>Though crampons &amp; ice axe are usually necessary this time of year, last season was a blessed (or cursed, depending on your inclinations) mediocre snow year, so we were treated to a minimalistic alpine experience with less gear and shockingly nonexistance mosquitos (spoken as the person who is always first to be bitten). You can see the climb from close to the trailhead, so if in doubt take a look with your eyes (maybe the day before if you’re getting a pre-dawn start), or better yet, get a friend peakbagging in the area to snap a photo for you (thanks <a href="https://ayeletbitton.com">Yelly</a>!)</p><figure><p><img src="bear-creek-spire-from-long-lake.jpg" alt="bear creek spire from long lake"></p><figcaption>View of the approach and route from the north end of Long Lake. Which is, admittedly, 2 miles from the trailhead.</figcaption></figure><p>After crossing the river downstream of Gem Lakes you would be led to believe by <a href="http://maximuspress.com/shop/proddetail.php?prod=GGA">Croft</a>’s approach map that you must bypass a “Restoration Area: Use Existing Trail” sign and proceed to stomp on sensitive wetland,</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="restoration-sign.jpg" alt="restoration sign, keep walking"></p><figcaption>oops</figcaption></figure></div><p>but if you walk a couple hundred feet further there’s now a luxurious and guilt-free developed trail that leads right and up to the biggest Gem Lake before dissolving into a talus slope.</p><p>As we ascended into the talus, we realised it is the friendly kind you can do a confident jog over.</p><figure><p><img src="talus-over-gem-lakes.jpg" alt="coming up from gem lake"></p><figcaption>Gem Lakes (and Chickenfoot lake to the right) in the valley behind us</figcaption></figure><p>We made our way up to Dade Lake as the morning brightened in earnest, although neither of us snapped a photo because we were concerned with refilling water, dropped our packs, and hiking on at top speed. The alpine lake was clear and quiet, its shores dotted with the bright tents of campers just waking up. Meanwhile, I was so hungry that I ate my lunch tamale, even though it was still 8am.</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="tamale.jpg" alt="tamale"></p><figcaption>always be feastin'</figcaption></figure></div><p>The last .3 miles were the worst, I am usually a decently paced hiker but I got hit in the face with altitude symptoms (despite having been fine when I was at 12k+ recently) and tried to find my way up the increasingly rotten and steep talus while looking through a straw with ears ringing. We were at the base and climbing around 9:30.</p><p><img src="bear-creek-spire-irl-notes.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Luckily the altitude felt better once I started climbing, while Marco continued to be completely unaffected because his body is a flawless machine. As I was fumbling around with sunscreen on the second pitch, he short-fixed himself and continued running up the rock in a mission to pass the one other party on the route.</p><p>We simuled the 3rd and 4th pitches (class 4) with a duck in the middle.</p><p>In the summer the route gets full sun, though a nice breeze kept it pleasant enough for sun shirts. We did encounter some shade at the top of the 5.8 (5th) pitch (which neither of us did as a chimney…?) which convinced Marco to put on his puffy.</p><figure><p><img src="5.8-pitch.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>coming up the 5.8 pitch</figcaption></figure><p>Marco climbed so fast that I had few opportunities to eat bars because my hands were constantly belaying! After that was more easy 5th to the ridge then summit, including a neat tunnel-through:</p><p><img src="tunnel-through.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The party we had passed earlier decided to solo to the summit, while I wanted to continue simuling, so they passed us here. From here we went up and along the ridge, dropping to the right when it got steep then up again.</p><p>We summitted around 2pm. (4.5 hours of climbing)</p><p><img src="summit-block.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Marco got signal and texted our housemates! From a bundle of slings, I did a 30m rap on another party’s rope (marco tossed it then downclimbed) and then we split a lunch burrito. There was a short traverse then sandy class 2 slog down the back side of the ridge.</p><figure><p><img src="abandoned-egg.jpg" alt="abandoned egg"></p><figcaption>a mysterious abandoned (??) egg found on the descent.</figcaption></figure><p>The trick to the descent is to not go through the lowest notch, keep hiking up and poke your head over the ridge occasionally until you see a class 3 route that veers north and down until you hit the approach trail again.</p><p>From there the decent was uneventful. Marco filled up water in the stream feeding Dade Lake, and we boulder-hopped back to Gem Lakes. We passed an older couple setting up camp, enthusiastically asking us how the climb went as they were going to attempt it the next day. I hope I smile that big when thinking about climbing when I’m their age.</p><figure><p><img src="descending-to-gem-lakes.jpg" alt="gem lakes again"></p><figcaption>going back down to gem lakes</figcaption></figure><p>We rejoined the trail at a spooky Sunday twilight hour when it was completely devoid of the usual tourist cluster–it was as quiet as when we had approached at butt oclock this morning, though my fears that we had wandered into a barren alternate sandbox universe was debunked when we got closer to the trailhead and overtook some fishers (who asked if they could catch a lift in our backpacks).</p><p>We caught up with Vanna at the trailhead at 19:25 and were home before dark! Cathie pulled up on the driveway to deliver her wedding invitation right as I was stumbling out of the van, and then we made mac and cheese while falling asleep, just in time for work the next day.</p><p>After that entire day I’m still wondering where the eponymous “Bear Creek” is. Let me know if you find it. \o/</p><p><em>Edited: 2020-08-06</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Red Slate Mountain is a 20 mile hike with 5700ft gain from McGee Creek Trailhead, mostly on scenic trail, with the last mile a straightforward class 1-2 scree ridge. It took us 10.5 hours. That’s a pretty good day, for a dog.</p><p><img src="caltopo-map.png" alt=""></p><p>We pulled up to the trailhead at 5:20am, with the morning light already arriving. The first couple of miles are pretty gentle, an unnotable sandy path.</p><div class="photo-small"><figure><p><img src="morning-trailhead.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>My butt with the Sierra ridges catching morning light as we begin.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We encountered a log bridge river crossing, which I confidently traversed without any help, to the surprise of the human pack.</p><p><img src="logjam-crossing.gif" alt=""></p><p>I was so excited to be playing with my friend Piton and his cousin Kami visiting from the city! They’re small but fast.</p><p><img src="mica-and-piton.jpg" alt=""></p><p>We leaped through meadows, terrorizing alpine chipmunks and sipping in streams. The skyline was dominated by contrasting creamy granite slabs, and red-streaked volcanic scree.</p><p><img src="meadow2.jpg" alt=""></p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="meadow.jpg" alt=""></p></div><p>I got so hot from running that I sat in a river crossing to cool off.</p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="stream-soak.jpg" alt=""></div></p><div class="photo-section">  <div class="photo-right-pull"><p><img src="little-mcgee-lake.jpg" alt=""></p>  </div><p>After passing a billion interesting lakes left and right, the human pack made their first and last stop at Little McGee to fill up their water bags. We scrambled down the talus to the water, and daiyi picked me up and dunked me in the chilly alpine lake!! Supposedly it’s because they knew it would be my last opportunity to cool off before the ascent to the pass and then the peak. I rolled on my back in the dirt to regain dignity and dryness.</p></div><div class="photo-section">  <div class="photo-left-pull photo-small"><p><img src="dogs-selfie.jpg" alt=""></p>  </div><p>The daschunds turned around here as the trail became a scree pile, so I said goodbye to Piton and his humans.</p></div><p>The terrain took a shift from soft dirt to red scree switchbacks until McGee Pass. I gazed into the next valley over, mentally calculating how many alpine chipmunks must be in there.</p><p><img src="mcgee-pass.png" alt=""></p><p>Suddenly, a new friend joins the party as we head for the summit. He walked really quickly to catch us, which is impressive for a human, although I am definitely faster.</p><figure><p><img src="red-slate-scree.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>In my natural environment, where I am shockingly camouflaged.</figcaption></figure><p>I encounter a surprise: snow! (Somehow the humans completely ignored this fun detour to roll around, prance, and dig).</p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="ridge-snow.jpg" alt=""></div></p><p>We arrive at the summit in time for lunch. Daiyi inhales a summit burrito without even sharing.</p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="summit-burrito.jpg" alt=""></div></p><figure><p>We had passed a couple backpackers heading down, but had the summit to ourselves.</p><p><img src="calling-leo.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>I watch in amusement as Yelly video calls Leo from the summit, classic.</figcaption></figure><p>As the clouds roll in, I become a donut and take a powernap.</p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="summit-powernap.jpg" alt=""></div></p><p>The breeze picks up, so the humans start down the mountain with the afternoon t-storm forecast in mind.</p><p>Here’s Little McGee on the way up, and then how it looked on the way back, ominous clouds and silver water:</p><div class="photos"><div class="photo"><p><img src="looking-back-on-little-mcgee.jpg" alt=""></p></div><div class="photo"><p><img src="back-to-little-mcgee.jpg" alt=""></p></div></div><p>By the time we hit the lake, I felt the first drop of water, and when we reached treeline we heard thunder! The hail started falling so fast that it hurt and we hid behind a tree for a couple minutes before the humans started to trailrun (which was my strategy all along).</p><p>After a couple of miles, we outran the rain.</p><p><img src="mica-shake.gif" alt=""></p><p>The final miles were longer and flatter than I remember. I even ceded my customary position at the head of the pack and heeled behind daiyi. We finally got back to the truck around 4pm. I was a tired dingo and became a donut on the asphalt as the humans did their post-hike stretches and drank their protein juices.</p><p>Back home, Leo made dinner for everyone (I had kibble and peanut butter).  I passed my bean check, no bloody toes even with all the scree, just a couple of hot spots, which makes sense considering my 10.5 hours of continuous trotting.</p><p>My second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Peaks_Section#SPS_List">SPS</a> peak completed, I collapsed into power-saving mode for the next 2 days, behaving like a normal dog for once.</p><p><img src="slepy-dingo.jpg" alt=""></p><p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://mountains.ayeletbitton.com">yelly</a>, <a href="https://www.peakbagger.com/climber/Climber.aspx?cid=18362">rafee</a>, <a href="https://daiyi.co">daiyi</a>, and sadie for the photos ✨</em></p><p><em>Edited: 2020-07-22</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Mi CTO daiyi traduce la historia de mi primera aventura de <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_bagging">peak bagging</a>.<br>– Mica</p></blockquote><p>✨</p><p>The summit of San Joaquin Mountain is situated so you can see both the dramatic granite of the Sierra valleys and hanging glacial lakes to the west, and also the volcanic red and white sand slopes to the east. The first 2.5 miles were on a OHV dirt road through a forest (also a popular mountain biking route), and the use trail after that is simple to follow because you just stay on the ridgeline the entire time. Easy for dogs like me.</p><p><a href="https://caltopo.com/map.html#ll=37.68623,-119.08888&amp;z=14&amp;b=f16a&amp;o=r2&amp;n=0.25"><img src="map.jpg" alt="caltopo map of trail"></a></p><p>The trail starts from Minaret Summit, a quick 10 minute drive from our house, which is why we pulled up late morning at 10am after a luxurious breakfast and coffee (I had kibble and water). The humans were strangely avoiding their computers this week, which ordinarily means spending every free moment climbing rock, but daiyi sprained a finger a couple days ago so we stuck to the ground this time.</p><p>During the forest trail, I ran laps around the humans and investigated the local wildlife!</p><p><img src="mica-digging.gif" alt="mica digging"></p><p>While trail planning, daiyi had misread the map thinking that the end of the OHV road was the end of the hike, so we only packed for 5 miles of water. Actually we were only halfway there! and at Deadman Pass is where the shadeless sand and scree slopes began. Luckily, I am a dog, so I didn’t get sand in my shoe like the humans did. Sandals not recommended.</p><p><img src="on-the-ridge.jpg" alt="mica on the ridge"></p><p>You can see the Minarets and Ritter and Banner on the opposing side of the valley for most of the ridge-top hike, they seemed to get closer and closer the entire time until you felt certain you would run right into them.</p><p>There was no water or snow except for a tiny patch on the side of the ridge, but I still found a couple mosquitos to snap at while the humans were stopped to eat their lunch burritos and plucots. The sun was out in full force, the sky was an uninterrupted blue. I was a hot dingo!</p><p><img src="hot-dingo.jpg" alt="mica seeking shade"></p><p>I sat down in the shade whenever I found the opportunity, but the humans kept us moving.</p><p>We reached the summit around 2pm.</p><p><img src="san-joaquin-summit.jpg" alt="mica on the summit of San Joaquin Mountain"></p><p>While the humans pointed their phones into the air and signed the summit register, I took a powernap in Marco’s shade.</p><p><img src="summit-register-nap.jpg" alt="mica sleeping under summit register"></p><p>I can’t read, but this is what they drew:</p><p><img src="summit-register.jpg" alt="our entry in the summit register"></p><p>Wait, we have to turn around?? Is this why the humans weren’t running circles the whole time like I was?</p><p>Here’s a view of the endless sandy ridge on the hike down:</p><p><img src="ridge-going-back.jpg" alt="sandy ridge"></p><p>That was my biggest day yet, but it’s only the beginning!</p><p><em>Edited: 2020-07-20</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Spoilers: it’s some trashy EDM about bottomless recursion:</p><blockquote><p>I do coke,<br>so I can work longer,<br>so I can earn more,<br>so I can do more coke.</p></blockquote><h2 id="—"><a class="header-anchor" href="#—">&gt;</a>—</h2><p>I was talking to someone I met at my first <a href="http://www.berlinminijam.de">game jam</a> (!!!) last month, and he responded to my usual yearnings for mountains immediately by identifying it as an addiction. I felt pretty put off by this because addiction is a word for bad things, but a couple days later it came up in my thoughts again. I am dependent on movement and freedom for happiness and I feel withdrawal when I don’t have these things, no matter how many other social/intellectual/career/emotional/artistic needs I’m hitting.</p><blockquote><p>I <code>&#123; exercise | hang out in nature | chill in mountains &#125;</code>,<br>so I can work longer,<br>so I can earn more,<br>so I can have longer gaps between soul-consuming full-time employment to <code>&#123; exercise | hang out in nature | chill in mountains &#125;</code>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="—-v2"><a class="header-anchor" href="#—-v2">&gt;</a>—</h2><p>I am suspicious of a lot of the public concern over “work/life balance” and “self-care” and the entire category of nice words symbolising nice ideas that are starting to grate on me from corporate overuse. It’s to the industry’s benefit if people recursed between being healthy and working more, so they have their own non-selfless incentives to loudly wave around the banners of self-care.</p><p>Yes a lot of individuals actually care about taking care of themselves. But even then, to what end? I’m concerned that for a lot of people, there isn’t much more than</p><blockquote><p>I <code>maintain this meat vessel of my consciousness</code>,<br>so I can work longer,<br>so I can earn more,<br>so I can <code>continue maintaining this meat vessel of my consciousness</code>.</p></blockquote><p>We’re all robots already! Nothing has changed in the last milleniums, we’re still all shackled to labor except we’re shoveling digital dirt instead of moving around actual dirt. I think about my old landlord who made part of his living buying stuff for cheap on ebay and selling it again. This really shouldn’t be a thing people need to do, it’s just spinning wheels and it’s ridiculous!</p><p>We occasionally have some friends who leave their solid and stable white-collar office careers to be carpenters and farmers. This sounds super cute, but from my perspective, my dad spent most of his life working his ass off to not be a carpenter and farmer. This context makes these things a little weird for me.</p><p>At this point I think I’m solidly in softcore existential crisis mode :^) Anyway I’m having a lot of fun learning clojurescript</p><figure class="highlight clojure"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">(<span class="keyword">defn</span> <span class="title">freedom</span> []</span><br><span class="line">  (<span class="name"><span class="builtin-name">cons</span></span> (<span class="name">rand-nth</span> [<span class="symbol">:nature</span> <span class="symbol">:mountains</span> <span class="symbol">:movement</span>]) (<span class="name"><span class="builtin-name">lazy-seq</span></span> (<span class="name">freedom</span>))))</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">(<span class="keyword">defn</span> <span class="title">life</span> []</span><br><span class="line">  (<span class="name"><span class="builtin-name">cons</span></span> (<span class="name"><span class="builtin-name">cons</span></span> <span class="symbol">:work</span> (<span class="name"><span class="builtin-name">take</span></span> <span class="number">5</span> (<span class="name">freedom</span>))) (<span class="name">life</span>)))</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">(<span class="name">life</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Clojure(/script) is a language and toolchain that I keep forgetting no one actually knows about because I spent most of my time these days deeply lodged in the loving nest of the clojure community. When I crawl out of this nest I get a lot of scepticism concerning my current life trajectory, like “why would you spend so much time on such an obscure thing when you could be learning a useful skill???” (the same flavour of scepticism I got a lot in Serbia where locals I met were like “why did you come here if you could literally go anywhere???”)</p><p>On one hand, why do anything at all? jkjk I’m not actually a nihilist those people are terrifying. The process of learning a language/toolchain/specialisation is transferable and does feel less insurmountable and more efficient every time, so there’s that clasic “learning to learn” thing. But also learning itself has intrinsic value, kinda like how art has intrinsic value because we decided so.</p><p>Learning, like art and music and socialising and mountains, fills in the spaces between <code>maintaining the meat vessel of your consciousness</code> and <code>work</code>ing, to make things nice.</p><p>It’s fun.</p><p>I have to be careful about trying to have too much fun.</p><p><img src="20170710.jpg" alt="comic"></p>]]></content:encoded>

My reading habits were a lot more erratic than when I was in a winter coma in Brooklyn; the cracks of idle time I’d been training myself to spend on books instead of flipping through social stuff on my phone got redelegated to things like staring at OSM, sending couchsurfing emails, and trying to figure out how to pronounce stuff in Serbian.</p><h3 id="Wikipedia"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Wikipedia">&gt;</a>Wikipedia!</h3><p>Oh, and reading cached Wikipedia pages of local/regional history/geology! which was such a great idea, it was the first trip I’ve done something like that and I would definitely recommend it.</p><p>In fact it was such a good exercise that I went back and cached the Wikipedia pages for places I’m quite familiar with. Notable selection: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hills_in_San_Francisco">list of hills in SF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Yosemite_area">geology of the Yosemite area</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Water_Wars">California water wars</a>. (also I found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Rock">this</a> … and here’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_City,_California">a classic</a>). (This wikidive is starting to inspire a roadtrip). (GREAT now I’m homesick for California :U )</p><p>And here’s the actual books I managed to read in my two months of tramping!</p><h3 id="Savage-Theories-–-Pola-Oloixarac-2008"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Savage-Theories-–-Pola-Oloixarac-2008">&gt;</a><em>Savage Theories</em> – Pola Oloixarac (2008)</h3><p><b>genre</b>  postmodern magical realism?<br><b>tldr;</b>  weird as hell, 10/10 would recommend</p><p>Pola Oloixarac is like Argentinian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">DFW</a>-lite. The entire time my brain was casually like “what the fuck is this shit” yet also strangely enjoying it. If you like David Foster Wallace/postmodern lit, you’ll know what I mean. If you don’t, you might not like this book, it is weird as hell. Try it! It’s a smashing and violent smorgasbord of the Buenos Aires alternative scene, evolution theories/philosophy, Argentinian history, and idk, how weird people can be.</p><h3 id="The-Handmaid’s-Tale-–-Margaret-Atwood-1985"><a class="header-anchor" href="#The-Handmaid’s-Tale-–-Margaret-Atwood-1985">&gt;</a><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> – Margaret Atwood (1985)</h3><p><b>genre</b>  speculative fiction, dystopian<br><b>tldr;</b>  good but (unpopular opinion?) like contemporary-junk-food-fic-good, e.i. Hunger Games</p><p>This was my first Margaret Atwood book!</p><p>I picked this up last winter because a lot of noise was made around the TV adaptation, and just got around to actually reading it.</p><p>My favourite part was seeing hints of the underlying 80’s feminist attitudes. I am such a fan of the meta-context of social-commentary-fic along with the context in the fics themselves! but maybe that’s just me being young and not having yet experienced much history myself. I like to imagine future kids reading fic from nowadays and being fascinated by contemporary SJW attitudes, ha.</p><p>The epilogue was a bit awkward, I thought it took away from the uncertainty and wispy dystopian feel of the story by contextualising it too much. I’d suggest not reading it and pretending it doesn’t exist :D Also check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid's_Tale">wikipedia page</a> after, it has some interesting info.</p><h3 id="Letters-to-a-Young-Muslim-–-Omar-Saif-Ghobash-2017"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Letters-to-a-Young-Muslim-–-Omar-Saif-Ghobash-2017">&gt;</a><em>Letters to a Young Muslim</em> – Omar Saif Ghobash (2017)</h3><p><b>genre</b>  non-fic, semi-autobiographical, culture, Islam<br><b>tldr;</b>  would recommend!</p><p>This was notably my first audio book ever. I “read” it on the bus from London to Edinburgh, because the air conditioning was drying out my contacts and I had to keep my eyes closed. This experience has relaxed my suspicion of audiobooks, or maybe this was just the perfect candidate: it’s written in second person, literally letters from the author to his sons, and narrated by the author himself, which made for a really good listen.</p><p>He talks a lot about his own life, a slice into the middle east for someone (me) who has very little context into what that’s like. At first I was like <em>ugh, this book would be so different if he had daughters to write to</em>, but then he addresses that too! I really really like how he urges his kids &amp; country to recontextualise their culture in the modern globalised world, to express themselves in productive ways, take responsibility for the good and bad things of their culture, and to create contemporary and relatable art and media. His optimistic and practical attitude was really heartening. And he communicates these thoughts really well (I can’t do it justice with a summary), like I almost want to take his ideas, generalise them a bit, and send them to my parents.</p><h3 id="Babel-17-–-Samuel-R-Delany-1966"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Babel-17-–-Samuel-R-Delany-1966">&gt;</a><em>Babel-17</em> – Samuel R. Delany (1966)</h3><p><b>genre</b>  OG sci-fi, micro space opera<br><b>tldr;</b>  groundbreaking sci-fi for its time, and aged well :D</p><p>Don’t read plot summaries for this! because it was really interesting to work out what the story was getting at about language and how it shapes thoughts, especially keeping in mind this was written in the 60’s. Apparently this story influenced a lot of sci-fi down the line, so reading this was a bit of a temporal pilgrimage in my favourite genre (:</p><h3 id="The-Man-Who-Was-Thursday-–-G-K-Chesterton-1908"><a class="header-anchor" href="#The-Man-Who-Was-Thursday-–-G-K-Chesterton-1908">&gt;</a><em>The Man Who Was Thursday</em> – G. K. Chesterton (1908)</h3><p><b>genre</b>  “metaphysical thriller”; police and anarchists being silly<br><b>tldr;</b>  It was fun!</p><p>Following <a href="http://www.daiyi.co/blog/2017/03/31/What-am-I-reading-March-2017/#A-Tree-Grows-In-Brooklyn-Betty-Smith-1943"><em>A Tree Grows In Brooklyn</em></a> while living in Brooklyn, I’ve been keen to read books set in the places I’m traveling to. While in London I’d remembered that Ilana had recommended <em>The Man Who Was Thursday</em> back when I saw her last December. It’s not really the type of book I usually read but I found myself enjoying it!</p><p>It involves turn of the century shenanigans of classically serious institutions (police? anarchists??) who were trying super hard to take things seriously, but things kept going spectacularly wrong in absurd twists. It seemed to be some sort of meta-satire, a short and fun read, different tone/mood that what I usually go for but I’d recommend it!</p><h3 id="Borges-A-Personal-Anthology-–-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1961"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Borges-A-Personal-Anthology-–-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1961">&gt;</a><em>Borges: A Personal Anthology</em> – Jorge Luis Borges (1961)</h3><p><b>genre</b>  short stories, mostly set in Argentina<br><b>tldr;</b>  very dreamy and I found it hard to focus while reading them, but they tend to be pretty good, yet oddly not completely satisfying, but I think this is the point.</p><blockquote><p>On the second floor, on the top story, the house seemed to be infinite and growing. <em>The house is not this large</em>, he thought. <em>It is only made larger by the penumbra, the symmetry, the mirrors, the years, my ignorance, the solitude.</em></p></blockquote><p>These are the topics Wikipedia says Borges writes about: dreams, labyrinths, libraries, mirrors, fictional writers, philosophy, and religion. This is a pretty rad aesthetic. I found it to be pretty accurate in this collection of short stories by Borges assembled by Borges, an early writer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism">magical realism</a>.</p><p>Because of the magical realism and short stories, I couldn’t help but compare this to García Márquez’s Strange Pilgrims which I <a href="http://www.daiyi.co/blog/2017/03/31/What-am-I-reading-March-2017/#Strange-Pilgrims-Gabriel-Garcia-Marquez-1970-80">read the month before</a>. I don’t know why, but I found García Márquez’s world a lot more satisfying, like nice popping sounds and things fitting into things type of satisfying. While I also liked these stories by Borges, they felt a lot more ethereal. Or maybe it was me, having been on the road for a while, projecting my losing of my sense of self (to be revisited in a future blog post :P) onto the stories. Definitely worth a read either way!</p><p>(Unforunately I accidentally returned the kindle library book before I got to save my bookmarks/notes so I can’t recommend the titles of my favourite stories.) But there’s a quote that accurately describes my feels sometimes that I’d had the forethought to have screenshotted:</p><blockquote><p>In the days and nights which followed the operation he came to realise that he had merely been, up until then, in a suburb of hell.</p></blockquote><h3 id="A-Problem-From-Hell-America-and-the-Age-of-Genocide-–-Samantha-Power-2002"><a class="header-anchor" href="#A-Problem-From-Hell-America-and-the-Age-of-Genocide-–-Samantha-Power-2002">&gt;</a><em>A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide</em> – Samantha Power (2002)</h3><p><b>genre</b>  non-fic, history, foreign policy<br><b>tldr;</b>  quite long and well-researched, if you’re interested in this topic this is the book to read</p><blockquote><p>&quot;From now on no government may kill off a large block of its own subjects or citizens of any country with impunity.”</p></blockquote><p>I mentioned I’d been reading a lot of Wikipedia history pages, so I caught up on a lot of Balkan history (and refreshed on WWI/WWII history, which is a topic of focus in a lot of European museums). I’d grown up with my mom heavily criticising our liberal American history classes for glossing over the Japanese occupation of China (which heavily affected her life), and to my <em>horror and embarassement</em> there seems to be an entire stack of more genocides I’d failed to learn very much about in school.</p><p>It’s cool, I’ve gone about fixing this. The first part of the book is about the Armenian Genocide and Holocaust leading up to this guy Raphael Lemkin devoting his life to outlawing genocide (he invented the word so people could wrap their brains around the idea) and how resistant world leaders were to ratifying this. It sucks that it has to be this way, but I can understand why. Like, what are we supposed to do?? You (a major world power) can’t not intervene because that is horrific, but intervening also causes all sorts of unintended destructive perturbation (I heard a lot of first hand accounts of this while traveling in the Balkans last month). Genocide is the titular “problem from hell” because you’re fucked either way.</p><p>The book is good, maybe even <em>too</em> good. It’s quite long, very well researched, many shocking primary sources (e.i. I can’t believe a person in this century believed this thing and said these words about human beings), and not exactly the kind of subject matter you can binge. I haven’t finished it.</p><p>Anyway. Heavy shit for the summer. I’ll probably skip to the second part that goes over historical accounts of genocide in Cambodia, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo (or skim on wikipedia) because I’m halfway through and it hasn’t recommended any actionable items, and there’s no happy endings, so I guess I’m just here for the history.</p><h3 id="Kindred-–-Octavia-Bulter-1979"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Kindred-–-Octavia-Bulter-1979">&gt;</a><em>Kindred</em> – Octavia Bulter (1979)</h3><p><b>genre</b>  extremely soft sci-fi, basically sci-fi brie, maybe sci-fi cream cheese<br><b>tldr;</b>  enjoyable pop fiction</p><p>It feels like pop fiction so I read it quickly, but it’s interesting to note that it was written in the 70s (the civil rights movement was in the 50s-60s). It’s about an American black woman who uncontrollably flickers between her present-day 70s to (oh no) a plantation in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_era">Antebellum</a> South. My first Octavia Butler book, and I’d take recommendations for similar authors \o/</p><h3 id="Essays-–-Ralph-Waldo-Emerson-mid-1800s"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Essays-–-Ralph-Waldo-Emerson-mid-1800s">&gt;</a><em>Essays</em> – Ralph Waldo Emerson (mid-1800s)</h3><p><b>genre</b>  essays<br><b>tldr;</b>  aahh…</p><p>Ok so I love nature and my life is basically man vs nature, so I expected to like reading Ralph Waldo Emerson. Turns out this writing is SUPER HARD TO READ, or maybe I’ve slowly become illiterate over the years since I’ve left high school. I shamefully prefer Wikipedia summaries of this beliefs and ideas over his actual writing. (Then again, I end up feeling similarly to most philosophers I’ve attempted to read). I made it about halfway through <em>On Self-Reliance</em>, but maybe it was because of insufficient coffee! We’ll try again next month \o/</p><h3 id="Whewww"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Whewww">&gt;</a>Whewww.</h3><p>Embarrassingly I don’t think I read a single book while I was in Croatia (the last two weeks of my trip).</p><p>It’s June! Holy shit. Where is the year going?? As of a week ago I’m back in steady-state city-life and finding myself super pleased with this thing where I’m not checking the <a href="https://misportal.hcr.hr/HCRweb/faces/simple/Map.jspx">mine map</a> for mines or memorising the names of the small towns between where I am and where I need to be or crash-coursing the Cyrillic alphabet (twice, after realising the neighboring country uses it slightly different). It’s kind of nice to sit down at a COMPUTER and type at a KEYBOARD.</p><p>I know, my dear readers are mostly office potatoes jealously eyeing my life of wild abandon but the point of all that was to remind me about the virtues of having a solid career :P And it worked! I’ll be sitting in offices all summer and I’m pretty excited about it, which was not an attitude I could see myself having last year when I was doing exactly that. I’ve got the sleeping on benches and camping in snow all out of my system and am pleased to rejoin society and partake in regular showers and non-disposable friendships.</p><p>Anyway, say hi if you’re in Berlin, I don’t have the budget to eat out but we can enjoy the LOVELY, PREDICTABLE, SUNNY BERLIN WEATHER with a park/canal/river stroll or you can come over and I can test my vegetarian cooking on you :D :D :D</p><p>And to conclude, a toast to a temporary end to my travels, here’s some thoughts from Borges on mortality:</p><blockquote><p>There is a nearby street forbidden to my step,<br>There is a mirror that has seen me for the last time,<br>There is a door I have shut until the end of the world.<br>Among the books in my library<br>There are some I shall never reopen.</p><p><cite>(Limits, Borges)</cite></p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

I’m either super into a book or throwing it away with disgust. \o/</p><h3 id="The-Best-We-Could-Do-Thi-Bui-2016"><a class="header-anchor" href="#The-Best-We-Could-Do-Thi-Bui-2016">&gt;</a><em>The Best We Could Do</em> - Thi Bui (2016)</h3><p><em>genre</em>  graphic memoir<br><em>tldr;</em>  MOST EXCELLENT, READ ASAP</p><p>This is a deeply personal graphic novel memoir about the complicated thing that is motherhood/daughterhood, churned up with living under communism, fleeing as refugees, and the dynamics of an immigrant family in America. I walked into a Barnes &amp; Noble on the way back from teaching one day (partly for the novelty of being inside a physical Barnes &amp; Noble in 2017) and picked this up randomly (or due to excellent strategic storefront arrangement/curation), and this is how I ended up crying in a Barnes &amp; Noble in the year 2017 of Luigi.</p><p>On one hand I feel like I can’t claim so much emotional reverb from this story because my own parents immigrated in a completely different way, but the ways in which we struggle to express our love and understanding for each other felt distressingly similar.</p><p>As with <em>The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em> which I read last month, I learned a lot of political history on the side of a thrilling/heart-rending story, this time about Vietnam. Also the art is REALLY GOOD. Thi Bui is amazing. Also I saw that she is living in the Bay Area (Berkeley!)</p><p><em>how to read this book</em>: with emotional fortitude.</p><h3 id="Strange-Pilgrims-Gabriel-Garcia-Marquez-1970-80"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Strange-Pilgrims-Gabriel-Garcia-Marquez-1970-80">&gt;</a><em>Strange Pilgrims</em> - Gabriel García Márquez (1970-80)</h3><p><em>genre</em>  short stories<br><em>tldr;</em>  enchanting, quick and satisfying vignettes, highly recommended!</p><p>García Márquez brings a sleepy dream of Latin American magic to stately Old World settings. Languid characters with jobs like singer and writer and magician living fantastic lives and feeling one thing at a time. The short story format is pretty righteous. The author has a certain way of describing people and circumstance that makes them feel tragically incidental yet fated with purpose.</p><p>I think my favourite was “I Only Came to Use the Phone”, but honestly they’re all so wonderful!</p><p><em>how to read this book</em>: a lovely interlude between your other heavy world-weary and technical reads.</p><h3 id="A-Tree-Grows-In-Brooklyn-Betty-Smith-1943"><a class="header-anchor" href="#A-Tree-Grows-In-Brooklyn-Betty-Smith-1943">&gt;</a><em>A Tree Grows In Brooklyn</em> - Betty Smith (1943)</h3><p><em>genre</em>  historic fiction<br><em>tldr;</em>  poverty and desperation + hope &amp; the pre-WWI american dream. it’s…really good.</p><p>This was a nice read after living on Brooklyn. I imagined the Williamsburg streets I walked and biked past all winter, a hundred years ago, right before the first world war. I’m having trouble writing this review, I think it’s because I have too many feelings ahh!</p><p>This is another immigrant story of a family navigating the unwieldy projection of parents wishing their kids to do better than themselves. (If you’ve been following along my monthly book reviews, this is totally an accidental theme).</p><p>The Nolans are poor and hungry and struggle to make rent, but are rich in song and laughing and stories and imagination, which made their lives bearable.</p><p>A lot of the problems on the minds of their people are still relevant – why are we so cruel to each other when our hardships should bring us together? why do we work so much and have so little time for ourselves? Is there anything more to life than this work/struggle/raise-family/work/die cycle, and how can we break it? It talks about poverty, race, education, family, and life meaning, in a way that I found endearing because I picked this up on recommendation from Connie a lot of years ago rather than was forcibly made to read it in high school to extract the human condition. I think you may like it, too (:</p><p>I loved that the characters are really strong! Both in character, and in the way they are written. Also lots of good strong coffee in this book.</p><p>The writing style is simple, a clean transmission of emotions and feelings and musing and hope directly from the characters to your brain in a way that thoughtleaders/marriage counselors only wish they could communicate.</p><p><em>how to read this book</em>: it’s an easy read, any time is a good time \o/</p><p><em>disclaimer</em>: this book is heavily gender-roletastic, because it was written in the 40s about 1900-10s. I usually find gender-role stuff pretty unbearable, but reading this with the time context I felt completely ok and even kind of illuminated.</p><h3 id="The-Confidence-Code-Katty-Kay-Claire-Shipman-2015"><a class="header-anchor" href="#The-Confidence-Code-Katty-Kay-Claire-Shipman-2015">&gt;</a><em>The Confidence Code</em> - Katty Kay &amp; Claire Shipman (2015)</h3><p><em>genre</em>  business/careers<br><em>tldr;</em>  Awkward and not helpful. Did not finish.</p><p>This book is about women and confidence in the workplace. I picked it up from the library because the <a href="http://www.shenomads.com">SheNomads</a> book club was reading it, but I couldn’t get through it. I found it blandly and unnecessarily heteronormative for something published in 2015, repetitive (more suited as a longform blog post rather than a book), and the stories and cases and studies collected didn’t feel necessarily more useful than like, your average 3 hours of browsing specific subreddits/twitter circles. Or 5 minutes of talking to any woman who has worked a job.</p><p>Maybe it’s for the people who don’t live in those parts of the internet, or haven’t any older women in their lives? I can vaguely see the appeal.</p><p>Either way, it needs actionable items. The writing style is cringey and heavy-handed at times, and early chapters are windy and unfocused.</p><p><em>how to read this book</em>: skim a summary.</p><p>–</p><p>And that’s it for March! I’m going without my laptop in April and most of May, but will hopefully have lots of time to read while on the road. chau o/</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three months later and I’m taking down my wall tapestries again, leaving the climbing gym where I’ve made friends with the regulars characters and routesetters, the cafes I work at often enough that they recognise my mannerisms but not enough that they remember my name, my tiny job, my tiny bike.</p><div class="photo-right-pull"><p><img src="the-cliffs-snow.jpg" alt="snow outside The Cliffs"></p></div><p>I came to New York with high hopes of learning fun computery things at recurse center and ice climbing upstate – I was rejected from rc, and found myself in the shortest and most indecisive, un-ice-forming conditions of northeast winter season in recent memory.</p><p>I did manage a lot of computery things on my own, was <em>super lucky</em> to have met excellent people who went out of their way to include me in their lives, and did some maintenance work on the fear and anxiety I occasionally accumulate around intellectual vulnerability and feeling competent if I’m not vigilant. I read a lot of books.</p><p>I think it was an ok way to spend some time.</p><div class="photo-small"><p><img src="rooftop-snow.jpg" alt="snow on the roofs"></p></div><p>In December I was in San Diego tessellating my objects into two checked bags, thinking I’d go live in New York for a long time. Metal and rope are bad at compressing so most of it was climbing and backpacking stuff by volume, but I did manage a few nice books too (:</p><p>I’m leaving having touched none of my gear, which I’m a tiny bit sad about. I marathoned the five-hour public transit daytrips up the Hudson every weekend the first month in a vague attempt at being in mountains before giving in to the cityfolk winter vegetable aesthetic.</p><p>I met Kat, another in the increasingly large fraction of my friends who have trucks and vans that they live out of, who hosted a gathering of mountain folks in a lovely cabin in the woods.</p><p><img src="cabin.jpg" alt="cabin in the woods"></p><p>Kat knew the Hudson River Valley and took me around in her truck, and I felt that I was first coming to understand New York through an outskirter’s perspective. We hiked some Hudson classics that the internet had warned me would be swarming with humans, but we found enchantingly lonely in the winter.</p><p>We ran into some friendly cave folks who taught us some caving basics! Ugh cavers are so cool. It was pretty rad fiddling with cave gear coming from a climbing background, comparing notes of all the similar but slightly different, specially adapted gadgets.</p><p>Kat left for her cave job in Oregon and I fell into a New York City winter coma.</p><p><img src="hart.jpg" alt="a winter forest in our home"></p><p>Housing in Brooklyn is somewhat affordable in a way that is unreal to a recent San Francisco/Bay alumn. My flatmates and neighbors are all friends with each other and form a loose family of sorts, with proper killswitches for introvert personal-time needs. Commonspaces are lovely with plants and kitchens are stocked and the house is warm and smells like cooking. This is what I’m going to miss most about here.</p><p>I don’t understand why simple habits take a different shape around each place. You’d think a urgency for caffeine would overcome physical continuity, but in this iteration of home, the aeropress and handgrinder I’d been so excited about and had used every day in Berlin lay untouched in the cabinet.</p><p><img src="f-train.jpg" alt="f train"></p><p>I live close to the subway, but a round trip costs a pint of nice ice cream (even in winter I compare the emotional value of my spendings against ice cream). I agonised over bleeding money from public transit and torturing my eyeballs from riding high speeds at freezing, but after going down a brief wormhole about vintage frames I nabbed a deal on craigslist.</p><p><strong>BIKES ARE THE BEST.</strong></p><p>So much ambient anxiety about my life choices dissipated after I regained wheeled status \o/ I need a hammerspace bike to explore the world with.</p><p><img src="east-river-park.jpg" alt="f train"></p><p>A friend I’ll miss along with my human friends, this little red aluminum bicycle that happens to be the same age as me, my adventure twin.</p><p>I’d originally been planning to travel in south america during the nothern hemisphere’s winter months, but after the election in November I felt so guilty for being in a selfish phase of my life that I decided to go to New York instead, to put my skills to work against something that felt so big and ominous and uncertain and terrible. We went to meetups and rallies and marches and talks and hackathons. I don’t think I accomplished anything in particular. I feel pretty ineffective in general.</p><div class="photos"><div class="photo"><p><img src="womens-march.jpg" alt="women's march nyc"></p></div><div class="photo"><p><img src="hack-the-ban.jpg" alt="hack the ban"></p></div></div><p>In the end I spent most of my time being selfish anyway. After two weeks of deeply inspecting and making web tools and demos and builds for the first time I feel like I’m on the verge of not being a poser when I tell people I’m a frontend engineer. I think I’m starting to understand one reason people like school: it’s a place where learning doesn’t feel weirdly self-indulgent. It is a context for guilt-free exploration, where the world waits patiently as you take and take and build the potential to give back. Stay in school, kids.</p><p>Time is going by too quickly for how much novelty I’m desperately shoveling into my human experience. Many things are happening, and a lot of them don’t feel real. It hasn’t registered that I’m going to be in Romania in a week and a half, not because it’s particularly shocking, but because it seems reasonable enough that it doesn’t require a second thought.</p><p>I was obsessive about spending my time as efficiently as possible when I set out on this nomadic year, but by now much of my anxieties over efficiency have been replaced by <em>I need nature asap</em> and <em>but I also need my computer because my brain is marinating in computery things!!</em> I’m feeling the multitude of narratives that is me fighting for dominance, and of the many things humans are good at multitasking is critically low on the list. This is something my brother says, and it’s been on my mind a lot. But how do I pick one thing when <em>everything is interesting?</em></p><p>These days I keep going back and forth between being really excited to be on the road again and seeing friends and reading and learning and chasing opportunities, and being exhausted from being excited about things.</p><p><img src="rocks-cityskyline.jpg" alt="central park sunset with snowy rocks"></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t get through much this month because I’m reading Modern Operating Systems in slow motion and Seveneves took forever, but here are the books I read in February! Part of an <a href="/blog/categories/what-am-I-reading">ongoing series</a>.</p><a id="more"></a><h3 id="The-Brief-and-Wondrous-Life-of-Oscar-Wao-Junot-Diaz"><a class="header-anchor" href="#The-Brief-and-Wondrous-Life-of-Oscar-Wao-Junot-Diaz">&gt;</a>The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao - Junot Díaz</h3><h4 id="fiction-really-good"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fiction-really-good">&gt;</a>fiction | really good!</h4><p>tldr: READ IT IT IS GOOD. HOly shit this book was turned up to 11. Completely unapologetically crass and carnal narration, chaotic bouncing around to different pov and people until the narrator materialises within the story themself. Intense, headstrong and tragic characters charging directly into anguish. Maybe because I was raised under a rock in upper middle class white suburbia but this book was bleeding a vibe and culture and a completely different way of experiencing america/the world than I’ve ever seen or heard and I liked that so much. And maybe the most surprising part that I didn’t bargain for but was amazed by, a stern talking-to about my ignorance of and catchup with a particularly brutal part of Dominican history, dictatorship under the Trujillo cult of personality. 1000/10 it’s a good dog read this book!!</p><p><em>How to read this book</em>: with wikipedia on hand for historic sidetrips!</p><h3 id="Seveneves-Neal-Stephenson"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Seveneves-Neal-Stephenson">&gt;</a>Seveneves - Neal Stephenson</h3><h4 id="speculative-sci-fi-I-liked-it"><a class="header-anchor" href="#speculative-sci-fi-I-liked-it">&gt;</a>speculative sci-fi | I liked it</h4><p>All in all middle-of-the-road Stephenson; it’s a single threaded plotline with fast paced edge-tickling action cut with long, more boring analysis/gratuitous description of random pieces of technology.</p><p>I can see some people being super into the future-tech deep dives but I just came here for the philosophical thought experiments about future human societies. The thought experiments are super interesting!</p><p>Some of the book is maneuvering the situation as to set up the various thought experiments so it does give off a bit of feeling contrived, and more softer scifi. I recognised this trade-off and felt pretty forgiving. I’d recommend this book if you like Stephenson, but if you’re new to Stephenson you should probably read Snow Crash or something instead!</p><p><em>How to read this book</em>: play along with the thought experiments and have a discussion buddy as you read; reading this book definitely felt more satisfying when I had someone to talk/rant about the ideas in it with.</p><p>Also DON’T READ the back cover summary (and I’m not even a person who cares about plot twists). It’s more motivating get through such a long book if you have no idea what’s going on :D</p><h3 id="Nonviolent-Communication-Marshall-B-Rosenberg"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Nonviolent-Communication-Marshall-B-Rosenberg">&gt;</a>Nonviolent Communication - Marshall B. Rosenberg</h3><h4 id="non-fic-I’d-recommend-it"><a class="header-anchor" href="#non-fic-I’d-recommend-it">&gt;</a>non-fic | I’d recommend it</h4><p>I like how this book formalises a lot of ideas I have floating around in my head about how to meet people where they are at emotionally, expressing your own needs in terms of actionable items, etc. (a whole 'nother topic for another time). I like comparing it against <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/769016.How_to_Talk_So_Kids_Will_Listen_Listen_So_Kids_Will_Talk">How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk</a>, which has similar axioms but angles it more towards parenting/interacting with children (which is really powerful for communicating with adults sometimes).</p><p>I’ve started teaching again this month and have gotten some nice reminders that putting these ideas to practice is a muscle I must constantly flex (like how I am starting to injure my back while climbing because I’m out of bouldering shape, oops).</p><p>Incidentally, I’ve also had a couple of encounters with adults that really put me in my place in terms of my wild expectations for how I can make my life better from self-improvement. (If people are super mad and feel entitled to making you miserable, it takes a better person than me to not regress to profuse apology in order to make them go away and stop yelling at me. Fuck that noise. I’m tired of people telling me I need to be kinder and more understanding and more gentle. That’s the case for the kids I teach, with my family, my friends, my peers and colleagues. If someone approaches you with the attitude that you are lesser than them sometimes there’s nothing you can do to convince them to respect and consider you as an equal. If a rando doesn’t want to be reasoned with FUCK them, that is super not ok and I will not be cornered into emotional prostration.)</p><p><em>How to read this book</em>: I find it really helpful to take bullet notes as I’m reading. I’ve discovered that I really need to jot down specific examples of phrases and words when reading these types of books, because the examples tend to illustrate ideas better than describing them in abstract.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hacktheban.org/">Hack The Ban</a> was an anomaly among tech events, with a focus on building relationships between local activist groups and the local tech community. Though the event was formed in response to the immigration executive order, organisations representing immigration rights/marginalised communities have existed for a very long time. Startup folk have an impulse to prop up new solutions when they see problems, which is great in many cases, but sometimes it is also worth considering joining forces with organisations that have intimate ties with and understanding of the community they are serving, a decade of work, and a diversity of skillsets and backgrounds and experiences.</p><p>Because it was a single day event, there was no sleep deprivation necessary, and due to the motivation/theme, the usual competitive factor that makes ordinary hackathons unappealing to some types of people (me!) was noticeably absent. Everyone wins at a civic hackathon (:</p><h3 id="mingling"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mingling">&gt;</a>mingling</h3><p>In the last few months I’ve been waving my hands in the dark around the question: “how can I be an effective activist? what do non-profits need from technologists?” After a morning welcome speech and warm coffee of happiness, there was a sort of non-profit club fair, where technologists got to ask questions and hear from organisers about their tech needs and the needs of the community.</p><p><img src="hack-the-ban.jpg" alt="hack the ban"></p><p>Some thoughts and observations:</p><ul><li>woah there’s no dedicated developer at a lot of these orgs. so it’s important that any tech setup (website, electronic donations page, email list) is very simple, readily safe/secure, and requires very little training</li><li>many orgs seem to feel a need for <em>something</em> (e.g. infographics, pamphlets, data visualisations) but can’t exactly articulate what it is. it is our job as technologists to extract their needs from listening to their goals, in a way that reminds me of being a tech consultant.</li><li>many things are done by hand (e.g. managing mailing lists). a no-background-knowledge-assumed kit/guide to automating these tasks could free up a lot of time/resources (but be careful of investment and maintenance time-cost)</li><li>with orgs that serve specific communities, <u>multilingual accessibility</u> is very important.</li></ul><h3 id="hacking"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hacking">&gt;</a>hacking</h3><p>Most of the participants came as individuals, and self-organised into groups that paired with the non-profits. I ended up among a wide range of experience and skillsets, and it was super cool watching everyone come together and the more senior folks take leadership, ask focused questions, and delegate. Thoughts from the hacking portion:</p><ul><li>project management and delegation is SO. IMPORTANT. good management is a productivity multiplier!</li><li>it’s great to be a generalist who can jump into things and figure out how existing stuff works</li><li>consultant skills are very useful – trying to decide tech stack, experience with working with different tools, pros/cons of various options</li><li>someone brought their graphics tablet, which was an excellent idea. I’m 100% throwing my wacom into my backpack next time for emergency wireframing/design prototyping</li><li>as with an ordinary hackathon, have project templates, communication channels, and staging environments ready to save precious time (but unlike an ordinary hackathon, it’s uncertain what existing systems we’d come across)</li></ul><p>I left feeling optimistic, with a reminder to be patient – it can be slow to find your footing within a space, be it industry or volunteering, because fundamentally it is about human relationships, which takes time. Slow is ok. I’m doing what I can.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I love browsing other peoples’ reading lists!</strong></p><a id="more"></a><p>My culture tells me that reading books is something a respectable intellectual should do a lot of, but it’s been pretty far down the list of priorities ever since I had to seriously come to terms with the fact that sustaining a regular sleep and exercise schedule is key to holding off crippling depression. Well now I’m on a nomadic sabatical and there is time for books again!</p><p>When I was back home over winter holiday, my brother was dragging his face through a book club book he hated, with the explanation that he found fulfillment in figuring out exactly what it was about a book that he hated. So I started a spreadsheet about my <em>feelings</em> of all the things I’ve been reading, because I too love dissecting my feelings and analysing my reactions to a precise degree yet still having very little command of my emotional muscles and tendons (a duality of theory/execution understood by anyone who has tried learning handstands or the butterfly stroke).</p><p>Here I’ll clean up and publish the monthly spreadsheet book reviews for your browsing pleasure!</p><!-- more --><h3 id="The-Fifth-Season-N-K-Jemisin"><a class="header-anchor" href="#The-Fifth-Season-N-K-Jemisin">&gt;</a>The Fifth Season - N.K Jemisin</h3><h4 id="fic-scific-10-10"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fic-scific-10-10">&gt;</a>fic, scific | 10/10</h4><p><em>The Fifth Season</em> is fucking fabulous, the best scifi/fantasy I’ve read in a really long time. The worldbuilding is stunning and thorough, depicting tribalism and societal manipulation in nuanced and real ways that is Too Real, you don’t get sat down with an explanation of anything that’s going on so there’s a lot of discovery (including the fact that the book is ACTUALLY SCIFI) through narrative, and every realisation feels intentional and well-placed. Queer/poly/trans representation is presented without cringe-worthy tokenness, and in fact is really good. Pacing is amazing and doesn’t let up. Graphic narrative that is so strong I had to read out of the corner of my eyes during particularly intense scenes. The way abusive emotional relationships (between family members, a racial group vs society, between mentor and student) are depicted are so tragic and multifaceted that you aren’t yelling at characters for doing the Wrong Thing, you’re angonising about how horrible and confusing being a person is. The writing does a bit of the high fantasy air to it (maybe that’s why I thought it was fantasy at first) that usually annoys me but I stopped being epsilon annoyed by it as soon as the story picked up. READ. THIS BOOK.</p><p>(also whenever I see a non-male author going by initials I get flashbacks of JK Rowling being advised that people wouldn’t read Harry Potter with a feminine name on the cover.)</p><h3 id="The-Obelisk-Gate-N-K-Jemisin"><a class="header-anchor" href="#The-Obelisk-Gate-N-K-Jemisin">&gt;</a>The Obelisk Gate - N.K Jemisin</h3><h4 id="fic-scific-read-this-if-you-liked-the-last-one"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fic-scific-read-this-if-you-liked-the-last-one">&gt;</a>fic, scific | read this if you liked the last one</h4><p>The second book in the series, continuing from before. It doesn’t win your heart with novelty like the first book, but it takes more steps into scifi and provides explanations and continues at breakneck pace. I liked it as a second book, and the third one is coming out later this year \o/</p><h3 id="Modern-Operating-Systems-Tanenbaum"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Modern-Operating-Systems-Tanenbaum">&gt;</a>Modern Operating Systems (Tanenbaum)</h3><h4 id="technical-computer-science-good-for-unrefined-systems-ragamuffins-me"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-computer-science-good-for-unrefined-systems-ragamuffins-me">&gt;</a>technical, computer science | good for unrefined systems ragamuffins (me)</h4><p>I’m reading along as my sister takes her major’s operating system’s course. This book gets personal with touches of snark and is what feels like a pretty approachable introduction to OS stuff. Weirdly enough it’s patching up the gaps of knowledge I have acquired through my backalley self-education on distributed systems as a bystander to the container wars last year.</p><h3 id="Limits-to-Growth"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Limits-to-Growth">&gt;</a>Limits to Growth</h3><h4 id="economy-systems-good-ideas-probs-not-worth-the-entire-read-for-most"><a class="header-anchor" href="#economy-systems-good-ideas-probs-not-worth-the-entire-read-for-most">&gt;</a>economy, systems | good ideas, probs not worth the entire read for most</h4><p>I am about 40% through this book. It seems to be a textbook used in some undergrad courses, about the world as systems and I noticed the terminology being similar to that of <em>Thinking in Systems</em> (which I also read 40% of, last year) – because Donella Meadows is an author on both books! It introduces a lot of interesting, abstract ideas on political and social sustainability with regards to growth, and the pitfalls of how politicians and voters think about growth and rates of growth. I got stuck at the part where the book goes into detail about water, land, and other resource consumption facts, which, while interesting and worthwhile, are probably more suited for a research project than my vague goal of trying to understand the big picture of why the world is going to shit. I’m planning to return to this book next month, skipping that section and getting through the rest of the ideas (maybe post my notes?)</p><h3 id="Training-for-the-New-Alpinism-Freedom-of-the-Hills"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Training-for-the-New-Alpinism-Freedom-of-the-Hills">&gt;</a>Training for the New Alpinism; Freedom of the Hills</h3><h4 id="Apparently-Freedom-of-the-Hills-is-the-Mountaineering-bible"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Apparently-Freedom-of-the-Hills-is-the-Mountaineering-bible">&gt;</a>Apparently Freedom of the Hills is the Mountaineering bible</h4><p>Mountaineering books that I started reading when I moved to the northeast and thought I would do a lot of mountaineering this season! That didn’t really happen for a variety of reasons, but that’s okay I’m going to be so prepared next year! Also I can’t believe no one told me how good Freedom of the Hills is as an introduction to technical mountaineering. Jeez. It’s just great. Super technical and with pictures!</p><h3 id="Ice-World"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Ice-World">&gt;</a>Ice World</h3><h4 id="technical-ice-climbing-it’s-like-a-story-and-also-a-manual"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-ice-climbing-it’s-like-a-story-and-also-a-manual">&gt;</a>technical, ice climbing | it’s like a story and also a manual</h4><p>This is an older technical ice climbing book that I started to read from my gym’s little climbing library when I thought I would do ice climbing this season :P Same story as above. I like how it starts with a bunch of stories, and has a friendly narrative-approach to teaching, including a section where the author instructs the finer points of glacier traversal by documenting the process of <em>teaching his wife through a hands-on expedition</em>.</p><h3 id="On-The-Road-Jack-Kerouac"><a class="header-anchor" href="#On-The-Road-Jack-Kerouac">&gt;</a>On The Road - Jack Kerouac</h3><h4 id="semi-autobiographical-travel-counterculture-DNF"><a class="header-anchor" href="#semi-autobiographical-travel-counterculture-DNF">&gt;</a>semi-autobiographical, travel, counterculture | DNF</h4><p>I didn’t finish this book. I couldn’t get into Jack Kerouac’s prose or the story. Which is super sad, because I’m a iconoclast hippie dirtbag like Kerouac and I keep seeing good quotes from his writing and praise for this work and I really wanted to like it! At first pass it should have everything I like a lot: stories from the road, weird hitchhiking stuff, the windy, uncommited flow of consciousness style that I love in Didion and post-modernists like DFW. I really disliked the people the protag surrounds himself with and feel frustrated that I have to spend time with these characters, who feel kind of worthless and kind of like the type of trash I have long cut out of my own life, sexist attitudes and dishonesty and fuck-all laziness and apathy and self-pitiful ennui. I just don’t need to wade through the maturity level of the social landscape of this time in the author’s life I guess.</p><h3 id="The-Golden-Compass-Philip-Pullman"><a class="header-anchor" href="#The-Golden-Compass-Philip-Pullman">&gt;</a>The Golden Compass - Philip Pullman</h3><h4 id="YA-fic-childhood-reread-exceeds-expectations-recollection"><a class="header-anchor" href="#YA-fic-childhood-reread-exceeds-expectations-recollection">&gt;</a>YA fic, childhood reread | exceeds expectations/recollection</h4><p>The subject of childhood rereads came up when I was hanging out with elementary/middle school friends over winter holiday, and I picked The Golden Compass to revist.</p><p>HOW is this a children’s novel?? The protag being a prepubescent child is the only thing children about this book. It deals with loads of mature themes (balance of power between church/state, love between a semi-immortal and humans), geography and culture comes at you really fast and without much explanation, plays on alt-history with renamings of abstract concepts (science is called philosophy or theology, electricity is called anbaric) that are hard to catch without an early high school education and without understanding of which it would seem a lot of the magic and meaning in the story might be lost?? I certainly don’t remember catching ANY of this in my first readthrough (in middle school). In fact I have retained almost nothing from the first readthrough except that there were daemons and armoured bears, probably because it all went completely over my head but I liked bears and wanted a daemon. It 1000% feels like a young adult book written for adults. Even more so than stuff like The Hunger Games, which doesn’t feel nearly as nuanced! Hunger Games feels so straightforward and civil compared to this world, jesus.</p><p>My one gripe is that, once I step back a little from the action and world-building, the plot appears very deus ex machina. Pretty much all conflict is overcome by a third party that miraculously swoops in with exactly the correct skillset to perfectly conduct a rescue. This is forgivable, given that it IS a children’s novel so it’s supposed to read like a story/tale rather than realistic rendition of how the world works, and that the action and characters are really exciting and distract from the plot drop-ins. Also the characters really pop and are super fun. Great book, great re-read, the opposite of disappointment!</p>]]></content:encoded>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am exactly as cool as I was before I started writing clojure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I am exactly as cool as I was before I started writing clojure.</strong></p><a id="more"></a><p>I’ve had a short, short life as a programmer and I’ve spent a lot of it making websites. Back in the day (as in a couple years ago) when I told other software people I’m a web developer, I got treated like shit. I was a lower class of coder because I wasn’t “solving cool problems” because making web sites is easy. It was sad and confusing to receive unjustified hatred but I loved the internet and I thought it’s pretty neat to make things that everyone can use and I like the visual component to my projects so I’d just go secretly cry in the bathroom (cool tricked I learned in college) like an ordinary functioning adult.</p><p>Somewhere along the way there was a massive rebranding so then I was doing literally the same things but now I’m a Frontend Engineer or UI Engineer. Occasionally I’d still get trashed by other coders but that’s ok, I even get to sit with the other software folks sometimes!</p><p>I found web and design communities where people do good web things and encourage each other to be better. It’s cool. Love is out there.</p><p>A month or two ago I started picking up clojure. I don’t know why other people learn new programming languages, but I didn’t know anything about clojure’s rich history and I wasn’t chasing the Beauty of Lisp or the superior mindset it would teach me or hoping to harness the performance or flexibility. I had no fucking clue about any of that. I’d just started reading <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp">SICP</a> because I missed computer science after bumping around in industryland, and it seemed trivial to swap scheme for clojure while doing the exercises in the book and end up being competent at a language I heard rumours that people use sometimes rather than a language I knew people used never.</p><p>And I liked it! It was my first lisp and yeah coming from javascript and python I liked the quaint syntax, and the way everything is all about these couple of data structures, and thinking functionally and non-mutably (word salad word salad). More significantly, I’d just left my previous job pretty much hating programming, and clojure was reminding me about why I like programming, and that was lovely. I noticed it was possible to use clojure to make UIs via clojurescript and figured it’d be a cool way to connect these two interests and go full circle.</p><p>I mentioned to some people I was learning clojure. Everyone was <em>super</em> into this. People started telling me I was really cool. I noticed people making all these wildly positive assumptions about my programming ability despite not having read a single line of code I’ve written ever. I instantly get elevated to a respect-worthy status for free and maybe for people who are used to being treated well that’s not a big deal, but coming from being treated like trash after telling people I am a web person the contrast was super intense and really obvious. I felt like I stumbled into a mystery bizarro-verse where you get dignity by default. It was SO WEIRD.</p><p>It’s fucked up that being interested in this random programming language, not even for the reasons the fangirls love it, suddenly caused everyone to start being nice to me when I’m in fact the same trash can that I’ve been all along. Coming upon the Correct Signal by accident made it all feel extra wrong and extra strange, like I killed a man and wore his skin for a suit and suddenly inherited all the achievements ever made in that body.</p><p>I know railing against signaling is itself a signal that I am a naive member of society who has yet to smash out of my youthful optimism chrysalis into the apathetic reality machine. Signaling is going to be there no matter what, because human nature. All I can do is reflect in stupid amazement at this experience and compel you to treat others with respect by default. Seriously.</p><p>–<br><span class="mute"><em>EPILOGUE 2018/07/29 15:11PST</em></span></p><p><span class="mute">Wowow HI HACKER NEWS \o/ my meatspace self (ordinarily in mountains on sundays) is having an unusually urban weekend at the <a href="https://explorabl.es/jam">explorables jam</a> when suddenly I start getting an influx of emails from (shockingly kind) randos.</span></p><p><span class="mute">I admit I am slightly terrified to wade into internet comments so I write to you here:</span></p><p><span class="mute">I had published this post out of bitterness shortly after I had decided to hard bail from San Francisco and live out of a bright orange backpack in various places doing various small projects and drifting in and out of small communities. I felt so adrift and disenchanted, if you know me then you know I have a huge amount of energy and at the time nowhere to put it to.</span></p><p><span class="mute">Right now I find myself back in California, but under a completely different set of circumstances and attitudes: I am doing work that I feel is meaningful on a supportive and gentle team, I live in a wonderful house of interesting and rad roommates, I see my family often, and yes I feel the ambient pressure of a young american professional, yes sometimes it is rough and I lose sight of what is good, but overall I am satisfied with my life trajectory and have found my niche in the world. It makes me so sad that my most relatable content is the things I have posted out of bitterness two years ago from a past life that I no longer empathise or identify with. But perhaps it will comfort you to know that things can get better! that there are wonderful communities out there, perhaps difficult to find, but they exist. Find these people, surround yourself with them, and lift others up with you when you have the bandwidth. I know that happily ever after epilogues ruin the story but this is a story arc that I want to trash because sometimes when you are in the depths of cynicism it feeds on itself and it is helpful to remember that things are getting better all the time, whatever you are in you can pull yourself out and one day you too can be jammin with fun weirdos into the sunset \o/</span></p><p><span class="mute">(if you want to interact with me your best bet is twitter @<a href="https://twitter.com/daiyitastic">daiyitastic</a> or email. please be kind.)</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

I have neither of those responsibilities right now! Posts will be serialised under <a href="/blog/tags/via-alpina">Via Alpina</a>.</p><h3 id="when-you-go-to-a-fancy-modern-country-to-sleep-on-the-side-of-the-road"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-you-go-to-a-fancy-modern-country-to-sleep-on-the-side-of-the-road">&gt;</a>when you go to a fancy modern country to sleep on the side of the road</h3><p>I love that the alps are super accessible (grandmas and dogs and babies all over the places, rails running out of every town to the top of every pass), and people go there specifically to enjoy the European charm and convenience of mountain cabins/huts. So of course I ignored all the modern comforts the country had to offer, wild camping and hitchhiking instead. I took one train, two hours from Zurich to my arbitrarily selected trailhead in Engelberg, which was a fresh and smooth experience that, like all the other Swiss things, put the quality of their counterparts in other countries to shame, but also used all my food budget for the month. It was lovely for being the only train I pay for my entire stay in Europe.</p><p>The trail was really developed and full of cows and people, so we got pretty creative about finding places to sleep! (Ominous foreshadowing music)</p><h3 id="Contradictions"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Contradictions">&gt;</a>Contradictions</h3><ul><li>I’m on a fairly tight budget, but Switzerland is notoriously expensive.</li><li>I like packing ultralight but I was flying to a wedding right and needed nice clothes ✨</li></ul><p>Even with cautionary tales of $20 McD from friends who visited earlier in the summer, I was unable to handle how crazy Switzerland prices were, even with my recent past life in the luxurious San Francisco tech startup reality sphere. We brought our food in from Germany, an excellent country with reasonable grocery bills and an appreciation for tasty dehydrated meals (in the US you have to go to a sport store for that).</p><h3 id="Here-are-some-ways-I-prepared-for-the-trip-because-I-sometimes-get-questions-about-how-I-travel-o"><a class="header-anchor" href="#Here-are-some-ways-I-prepared-for-the-trip-because-I-sometimes-get-questions-about-how-I-travel-o">&gt;</a>Here are some ways I prepared for the trip, because I sometimes get questions about how I travel \o/</h3><p>Basically I like to collect a ton of info so I can put off deciding on specifics for as long as possible.
