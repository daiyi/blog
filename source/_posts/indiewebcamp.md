<strong>or, justification for satisfying annual urge to completely revamp web presence.</strong>

I am inspired by the promises of an [Indie Web](https://indieweb.org/why). Owning your data, cool. A single source of truth to your content and identity, nice. Possibility of sinking countless hours into configuring your own corner of the internet, ok you got me there.

I'm hearing some rattling in my internet social spheres about how content silos are making the internet more homogeneous, forcing you to conform and contort your thoughts into prescribed formatting, that force of nature that causes experts in their fields to blast out 50-part tweetstorms that should be written in an article instead. Hey you sound exactly like the indiewebcamp people!

Go [check it out](https://indieweb.org/). They're nice, too (:
