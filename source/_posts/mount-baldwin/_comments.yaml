    I do not know if it's just me or if everybody else encountering issues with your 
site. It seems like some of the written text on your 
content are running off the screen. Can someone else please provide feedback and let me know if this is happening to them as well?
This could be a problem with my internet browser because 
I've had this happen previously. Many thanks
