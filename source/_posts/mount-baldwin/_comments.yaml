    My coder is trying to convince me to move to .net from PHP.
I have always disliked the idea because of the costs.
But he's tryiong none the less. I've been using WordPress on various websites for about a year 
and am worried about switching to another platform. I have heard excellent things about blogengine.net.

Is there a way I can transfer all my wordpress content into it?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
