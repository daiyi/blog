    Hello! I know this is kind of off topic but I was wondering which blog platform are you using for 
this website? I'm getting sick and tired of Wordpress because I've had issues with hackers and I'm looking at alternatives for another platform.
I would be great if you could point me in the direction of 
a good platform.
