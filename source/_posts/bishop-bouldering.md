Happy new year! üêØ Êñ∞Âπ¥Âø´‰πê

In the current revision of my life, I find myself bouldering outdoors basically as much as my body can handle without actually imploding. Last month I made the 2-hour round-trip commute to Bishop 13 days out of 31:

Last season I gave bouldering a real try for the first time, and I managed to struggled up a couple v1's between cold swollen toes, hip injury, and general fears being outside my rope-climbing comfort zone (I'm short, all the holds are far away and bad, I'm weak and only manage to climb with cardio and technique, I don't want to fall and break my leg, a 5-minute approach is for bums and my true passion is hiking a bag of ropes and metal deep into the backcountry, etc).

It's been 6 weeks into my second season, and I have already climbed six v3's??? and am working v4-5. Exciting! Shocking?? This doesn't make any sense considering I mostly climbed moderate alpine/trad all summer, popped a finger on the kilterboard at the start of October, and continued to not really climb until mid-December. Does training even mean anything?? who knows.

A plausible contributing factor: six weeks ago, my hip spontaneously collapsed and I could barely walk for a two weeks (labral tear relapse?). No longer was I distracted with all my other hobbies, such as trail running, XC skiing, downhill skiing, the hip-intensive descent to the Gorge, and walking through the grocery store or up the stairs. Somehow, I could still boulder. I can't explain it.

So as the gears of time clicked into place at the start of 2022 our year of Luigi, my friends carried all the pads, my stuff, and sometimes me to the Happy, Sad, or Buttermilk boulders every weekend. I used hiking poles as crutches to limp around. By the time I navigated my new insurance to re-begin physical therapy, I was already climbing 2 grades harder than I had before my injury, yet comically living in constant fear of opening a car door while standing on the icy driveway, or turning my foot the wrong way while laying in bed.

Being totally focused on 1 thing is surprisingly nice. I'm still at the low-ego new-activity stage so I don't feel bad if I don't succeed, I just feel good to be out of the house and able to do anything that feels normal and empowering. And it's a lot more fun now that I'm at a level where I can project with friends (I've also made friends closer to my level and size in the last year, and that's made a big difference too).

Being injured in a way that isn't legible to others leaves me feeling pathetic a lot of the time because I need to ask simple favours from people who probably think I'm just really lazy and bothering them. When I feel too prideful and try to attempt the task myself, I get hurt and end up setting my recovery back, but asking for stuff really sucks. While rehabilitating a functionally useless wrist/hand/elbow a couple of years ago, my doctor suggested wearing a wrist brace at work, partially as a signal to others so they don't judge me when I ask for favors or exemptions (such as declining to take notes at a meeting or move heavy objects). I think about that a lot. Aside from walking around with a limp or sometimes spontaneously collapsing, I otherwise appear totally normal. Most days, I feel lucky that I can do anything at all.

Q: Do you want to climb at Pine Creek?
A: yeah! If it's warm! I don't want to be super cold if I could be beach vibes on the boulders instead:
