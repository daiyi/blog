    Great post. Glad to hear you enjoyed SICP :) I've noticed this too, especially towards front-end as you say, also in general using "old" or "easy" tech like PHP or Python vs whatever FOTM deep neural network written in Rustlang on Kubernetnes or something. I see this a lot with vim/emacs too.

    It seems to me that it's relatively hard to gauge how "good" a software person so one identifier people use is various types of tech, especially those perceived as difficult to learn or abstract or niche. And then because no one can learn everything, most of these stereotypes are unfounded entirely.

    Possibly we're conflating "using difficult tech" with "being a good engineer"? Should we be asking people we meet, instead of what languages they know, what causes they're interested in or what they're trying to achieve with whatever tech they choose to use? I don't think this quite covers all the bases, some people like learning languages for the sake of learning them/the paradigm, but I think this could be a better way to learn about someone. Perhaps this doesn't really address your point of being respectful no matter what.

    Last thing that's slightly off-topic, have you been working on any cool new things in ClojureScript? I tried setting up figwheel a while ago but couldn't really figure it out...but reagent, garden, etc. look pretty cool, especially as a way to think about the DOM statelessly.

    I noticed this in inverse; ever since I went from doing Infrastructure and DevOps to Frontend FT, I've felt slightly embarrassed about the fact that I only write JavaScript now, even though I think it's a cool ecosystem with a thriving community.

    <a href=https://www.tcsindustry.com/pro/Daptomycin_103060-53-3_dose_class_side_effects_and_price.html>daptomycin</a>, sold under the brand name cubicin among others, is a lipopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of systemic and life-threatening infections caused by gram-positive organisms. it is a naturally occurring compound found in the soil saprotroph streptomyces roseosporus. its distinct mechanism of action makes it useful in treating infections caused by multiple drug-resistant bacteria. 
 
daptomycin was removed from the world health organization's list of essential medicines in 2019. the world health organization classifies daptomycin as critically important for human medicine. 
 
 
medical uses 
daptomycin is indicated for use in adults in the united states for skin and skin structure infections caused by gram-positive infections, s. aureus bacteraemia, and right-sided s. aureus endocarditis. it binds avidly to pulmonary surfactant, so cannot be used in the treatment of pneumonia. there seems to be a difference in working daptomycin on hematogenous pneumonia. 
 
adverse effects 
common adverse drug reactions associated with daptomycin therapy include: 
 
cardiovascular: low blood pressure, high blood pressure, swelling 
central nervous system: insomnia 
dermatological: rash 
gastrointestinal: diarrhea, abdominal pain 
hematological: eosinophilia 
respiratory: dyspnea 
other: injection site reactions, fever, hypersensitivity 
less common, but serious adverse events reported in the literature include 
 
hepatotoxicity: elevated transaminases 
nephrotoxicity: acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis 
also, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients simultaneously taking statins, but whether this is due entirely to the statin or whether daptomycin potentiates this effect is unknown. due to the limited data available, the manufacturer recommends that statins be temporarily discontinued while the patient is receiving daptomycin therapy. creatine kinase levels are usually checked regularly while individuals undergo daptomycin therapy. 
 
in july 2010, the fda issued a warning that daptomycin could cause life-threatening eosinophilic pneumonia. the fda said it had identified seven confirmed cases of eosinophilic pneumonia between 2004 and 2010 and an additional 36 possible cases. the seven confirmed victims were all older than 60 and symptoms appeared within two weeks of initiation of therapy.
