    micafungin, sold under the brand name mycamine, is a polyene antifungal medication used to treat and prevent invasive fungal infections including candidemia, abscesses and esophageal candidiasis. it inhibits the production of beta-1,3-glucan, an essential component of fungal cell walls. micafungin is administered intravenously. it received final approval from the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) on march 16, 2005, and gained approval in the european union on april 25, 2008. 
 
indications 
micafungin is indicated for the treatment of candidemia, acute disseminated candidiasis, candida peritonitis, abscesses and esophageal candidiasis. since january 23, 2008, micafungin has been approved for the prophylaxis of candida infections in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct). 
 
micafungin works by way of concentration-dependent inhibition of 1,3-beta-d-glucan synthase resulting in reduced formation of 1,3-beta-d-glucan, which is an essential polysaccharide comprising one-third of the majority of candida spp. cell walls. this decreased glucan production leads to osmotic instability and thus cellular lysis.
