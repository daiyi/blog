    Thanks for sharing, I love long day hiking and the pain of talus, which I generally assume most trip reports are exaggerating because of how excruciating it can *feel*. But in this case, I donâ€™t think the best writer in the world could accurately convey how much talus you crossed. The only other thing I can think of that may have crossed that much talus is the Mars rover.

    Anyway, I love exploring the Ritter range and am always looking for new views, cool to see the peaks from this spot.

    My tolerance for talus grows stronger with each passing year of living in the Sierra, but I am still not sure I would be able to face that particular route without hesitation! 

    If you want a related view definitely check out neighboring [Rodgers Peak](../rodgers-peak/), from which you can see Ritter, Banner, *and* Davis. In the opposite direction you can see straight to Half Dome!

    Thank you for your comment, it's really a joy to run into other internet wanderers seeking the obscure, and I often wonder if anyone but my friends reads these trip reports. See you in a summit register.
