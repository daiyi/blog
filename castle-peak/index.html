    Castle Peak!

<p>I haven’t spent much time around Truckee, except to climb/pick blackberries at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105733929/the-emeralds">the Emeralds</a>, or crag at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105733935/donner-summit">Donner Summit</a>, so I made a stop on way home from Washington and Oregon (escaping the fire smoke up north) to finally do a hike in fresh air. Kind of grim, knowing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldor_Fire">what’s to come</a>.</p>
<p>I devised this loop out of Donner Summit/Castle Pass Trailhead that hits two peaks and a lake, which was about 17 miles, 5000 ft of gain, and took me 8.5 hours with plenty of swimming and sitting around enjoying the view :D Castle Peak itself took me 1.3 hours to summit.</p>

<p>The dirt road to the trailhead was a bit spooky for me, even though I had the 4x4 high clearance van, so I parked in a pullout 1.1 miles before the actual trailhead.</p>

<p>At the pass, the vert begins, with a solid use trail the entire way. It’s steep and sandy, but not so bad and overall pretty frontcountry. As a testament to that, I saw a parent going up carrying a toddler in a backpack.</p>
<p>After gaining the summit ridge, there’s some fun slabs and use trail traversing past the little castles to the biggest castle, on the eastmost side of the ridge.</p>

<p>The scramble to the top was a cool ramp full of big blocky jugs sticking out. It took me about 1 hour 20 to reach the summit of Castle Peak from where I parked partway up the road!</p>

<p>I hung out on top for quite a while, honestly marveling at the novelty of blue skies. Heading down, I encountered another solo hiker who was also contemplating going to Basin Peak, but spooked by the exposure of the connecting ridge and the red flag winds. I was actually glad for the wind, since I started hiking in the middle of the day and it would have been otherwise extremely hot. Also, the ridge looked so pastoral and cute. I munched on dried mangos and headed towards Basin.</p>

<p>Ok, scrapping the plan for Devils Oven Lake, I continued onward to check out Warren Lake</p>

<p>Warren Lake is REALLY nice. Secluded, with backcountry camp sites, and I heard there’s good fishing. Perhaps the lack of visitors is due to the steep 1000-foot drop over 1 mile to get down to the lake. The fun part is climbing back out after :P</p>

<p>After climbing out of Warren Lake, I was totally sweaty and sticky as I was when I had started. Now I looped back towards where I parked, taking Warren Lake Trail. Luckily it was late in the day, so I got some relief from the heat in the shadow of the Castle-Basin ridge.</p>

<p>Crossing over the last pass of the day, I took a small detour to Frog Lake lookout. Ominous smoke in the distance (I’m guessing from Dixie Fire).</p>

<p>The rest of the hike was pretty downhill! It was already dark by the time I passed the Donner Pass rest stop (kind of funny that the trail cuts so close to the highway).</p>
