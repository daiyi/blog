    Hi there just wanted to give you a quick heads up.
The words in your post seem to be running off the screen in Safari.
I'm not sure if this is a formatting issue or something to do with 
internet browser compatibility but I figured I'd post to let you know.
The design look great though! Hope you get the problem resolved soon. Cheers
