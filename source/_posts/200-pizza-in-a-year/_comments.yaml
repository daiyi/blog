    Fashion trends in next year will introduce a blend of modern looks and retro influences. Eye-catching shades and unusual pairings will dominate. Eco-friendly clothing will gain even more popularity, with brands introducing a wider range of organic fabrics. Baggy shapes and layered looks will remain in demand. High-tech features, such as smart fabrics, will be incorporated into casual wear.
