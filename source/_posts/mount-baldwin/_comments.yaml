    Hello there! I know this is somewhat off topic but I was wondering 
which blog platform are you using for this website?
I'm getting sick and tired of Wordpress because I've had 
problems with hackers and I'm looking at alternatives for another 
platform. I would be fantastic if you could point me in the direction of 
a good platform.
