## How to add comment on a post

- find the post under https://github.com/daiyitastic/blog/blob/master/source/_posts

- add your comment to the list!

  ```yaml

  ```

- every field is optional. you can use [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) in the comments field:

  ```yaml
