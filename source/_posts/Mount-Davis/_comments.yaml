    Thanks for sharing, I love long day hiking and the pain of talus, which I generally assume most trip reports are exaggerating because of how excruciating it can *feel*. But in this case, I donâ€™t think the best writer in the world could accurately convey how much talus you crossed. The only other thing I can think of that may have crossed that much talus is the Mars rover.

    Anyway, I love exploring the Ritter range and am always looking for new views, cool to see the peaks from this spot.
