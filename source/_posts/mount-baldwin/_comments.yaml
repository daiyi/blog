    My programmer is trying to convince me to move to .net from PHP.
I have always disliked the idea because of the costs. But he's tryiong none the less.

I've been using WordPress on numerous websites for about a year and am nervous about 
switching to another platform. I have heard very good 
things about blogengine.net. Is there a way I can transfer all my wordpress 
content into it? Any kind of help would be greatly appreciated!
