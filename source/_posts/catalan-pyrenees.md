Today my erstwhile home Mammoth Lakes officially smashes the biggest snow year on record, and I'm bundled up inside reminiscing on warmer times, and the stupid shit I miraculously pulled off in my younger and more durable days. Nearly 10 years ago, I accidentally went on my first solo backpacking trip. Without a clear reason, I'd always wanted to visit Spain, and after a series of tragi-comedy no-goes, I was extremely broke and hitchhiking from Barcelona to the Spanish Pyrenees by myself.

I took the last leg by train, to Puigcerdà (pronounced Poo-*chair*-da).

Europe is not the temperate Sierra Nevada, or the deserts of Utah (the only places I'd backpacked previously). These mountains are juicy, and I was immediately schooled by many hours of pouring rain! I wrapped my backpack with my tent tarp, which did the job, but I remember my fingers being SO COLD.

My first time in a mountain outside the US, I was shocked to run into refugios, huts, cabins, and villages. Why was there civilisation in the mountains? How is there so much livestock? Imagining cows stomping my analogous home mountains of the Sierra felt so alien.

I remember trying to infer the culture from the artifacts, like the unmanned refugios–was I allowed to stay the night? I peaked inside a collection of them, the range of quality was very broad:

I didn't do any trip planning aside from a vague goal to exit from Andorra (the mini-country sandwiched between Spain and France). Since it was 10 years ago, I bought a paper map, and stitched together sections of the GR-11 and Haute Route. I had primitive offline gps phone maps (probably OSM), but didn't load tracks or route names.

Maybe this is a factor of it being 10 years ago (pre-backpacking explosion), or perhaps my pieced-together routes rather than sticking to a single JMT-like superhighway, but I remember the trek being so desolate. There were hardly any people after leaving the villages. In my last day, I remember feeling so lonely I was singing out loud just to hear my voice.

I have a distinct memory of the trails to and from the alpine passes feeling much steeper than American trails, and wondered if they'd been cut before switchbacks were invented. (Would I still feel this way, with all the fitness and experience I have now?)
