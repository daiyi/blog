    My programmer is trying to persuade me to move to .net from 
PHP. I have always disliked the idea because of the expenses.

But he's tryiong none the less. I've been using WordPress on several websites 
for about a year and am worried about switching to another 
platform. I have heard very good things about blogengine.net.
Is there a way I can transfer all my wordpress content into it?
Any help would be really appreciated!
