What a fun half-day! Compared to many Sierra peaks, this one is easy yet scenic. And friendly for dingos! Highly recommended!

- trailhead: Saddlebag Lake
- route: Southwest Slope, class 2
- total distance: 10 miles (16km)
- elevation gain: 3000ft (915m)
- total time car-to-car: 5 hours
- tough for dogs?: nope!

Hot tip for shoe wearers: _trail gaitors_ came in handy for surfing down the sand slopes on the descent.

After waking up with a spontaneous urge to tag a peak, we drove an hour to Saddlebag Lake Campground and had a luxuriously late 11am start:

After an hour of brisk trotting, the trail gets a little scrambly as it leaves Greenstone Lake and makes its way up to the first of the Conness Lakes:

Then I finally saw snow!

I went right up the snow but it was easy to walk around for humans with less capable paws. A couple minutes later we were at the first Conness Lake:

Continuing on the highest Conness Lake, we encountered our first big patch of snow. I ran right across the sloshy sun cups, but the human beta was to scramble around the left side:

<p class="large">Once at the last Conness Lake, it's time to go up on sandy scree slopes. It's steep at times but there's a million use trails so you can't go wrong. A party of two coming down as we started up passed with a mysterious message: "the fight begins...". So ominous! Was there going to be a band of armed marmots blocking the path? At 2 hours 20 min into the total hike, we got to the ridge having eluded the prophesied fight.</p>

The rest was an easy 20 minute walk to the summit on compact sand.

Hiking back from the summit took about 2 hours. The sandy slope makes a quick descent!

Just a minute from the parking lot, I saw a big coyote and I chased it!! I dropped the chase when I heard a scream from my human companion. This is the second coyote I've seen at Saddlebag this season, so other dingos beware!
