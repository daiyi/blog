<p>Merino wool is very important to me, a sweaty monster that struggles with temperature regulation, because it doesn’t feel terrible to sweat into yet also keeps you toasty on the other end of the climate spectrum. It’s a popular activewear material for its natural antimicrobial/antiodor properties, which it presumably inherits from its days of living on a sheep. I have found the hype to be real: camp out of a vehicle for a while and it becomes evident who is wearing synthetics (ripens quickly, like a banana), cotton (honorable mention), or merino (actual miracle fiber).</p>
<p>The downsides to merino are that it’s fragile, and heckin spendy (I guess it’s cheaper to make plastics than wait for sheep to grow), which is how I ended up hoarding a pair of mortally wounded merino leggings beyond its usefulness, unwilling to throw away the precious material that had dutifully warmed my legs in the backcountry for 6+ years.</p>

<p>I’d just been looking for merino fingerless gloves and buff earlier and was procrastinating on purchasing because $40+ for simple tubes garments seemed excessive. This inspired me to try sewing them myself :D</p>

<p>This was the easiest, there was no actual sewing involved after cutting off the leg segment! Turns out my leg width is also my neck width. I just had to darn a small hole.</p>

<p>Oh snap, accidental styling?? “Officier, I swear I was just trying to stay warm.”</p>

<p>This was tricker, because one of the leg segments had big rips to work around. The tubes ended up being straightforward to sew. For the thumbs, I just left holes. I’m considering adding thumb attachments in the future, although the nice thing about the simple tube is that I can use them as running mitts by folding them over my hands. And also, I’m lazy.</p>

<p>A success! I’ve been wearing these new, un-holey accessories nonstop (maybe I should figure out how to use the so-called smart thermostat).</p>
<p>What should I do with the leftover fabric? There’s quite a bit but the shape is irregular, and I don’t have more cylindrical body parts left in need of coverage. Maybe I could double-layers the hand warmers, my hands are always freezing T_T</p>
