Here I am totally passed out in the front yard, instead of my normal squirrel-hunting self.

How did I get here??

Yesterday I climbed Mount Julius Caesar (13,200ft) with my housemate [Yelly](https://mountains.ayeletbitton.com/). It's [my 8th SPS](https://www.peakbagger.com/List.aspx?lid=5051&cid=30263), and my second time above 13,000ft this month (I am a high-altitude dingo).

Yelly had barely returned from [summitting the tallest mountain in North America](https://mountains.ayeletbitton.com/post/653940349843259392/denali-gear) before getting back on her quest to tag the SPS list. Everyone else was busy with their "jobs", but I was available, so Yelly took me along.

We started out at Pine Creek Pass, where you can see strange mining machines.

This was a really long and tiring hike (20 mile, 6100ft vertical gain) and I was huffing and puffing since I don't have many sweat glands! I found shade when I could, but snow is my favourite way to stay cool. There was very little snow last winter, so I'm enjoying the remaining patches while I still can!

This peak is mostly friendly for dogs, although I did get overambitious and took a whip off a big slab boulder and fell onto my back. Mysteriously, I seemed totally undeterred and continued just fine.

The summer is just beginning so I'm still getting my alpine legs on. I will grow stronger as the season continues, but for now you'll find me in my resting donut form.
