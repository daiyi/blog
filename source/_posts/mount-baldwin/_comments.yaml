    I think what you published was very reasonable.

However, think on this, what if you were to create a awesome headline?
I mean, I don't wish to tell you how to run your website, but what if you 
added something that makes people desire more? I mean Mount Baldwin (12,598ft) &mdash;&nbsp;daiyi is a 
little plain. You should peek at Yahoo's home page and watch how 
they create article titles to get people to click.
You might add a related video or a related 
pic or two to get readers excited about everything've got to say.
In my opinion, it might bring your posts a little bit more interesting.
