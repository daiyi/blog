    Hey there would you mind stating which blog platform you're 
working with? I'm planning to start my own blog soon but I'm having a difficult time 
deciding between BlogEngine/Wordpress/B2evolution and Drupal.

The reason I ask is because your layout seems different then most blogs 
and I'm looking for something unique.                  P.S Apologies for getting off-topic 
but I had to ask!
