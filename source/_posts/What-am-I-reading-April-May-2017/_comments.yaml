    Hello! I know this is kinda off topic but I was wondering which blog platform are you using for this website?
I'm getting sick and tired of Wordpress because I've had issues 
with hackers and I'm looking at alternatives for another 
platform. I would be great if you could point me in the direction of a 
good platform.
