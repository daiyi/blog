    First of all I would like to say wonderful blog! I had a quick question in which I'd 
like to ask if you don't mind. I was curious to know how you center yourself 
and clear your head prior to writing. I've had difficulty clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out there.
I truly do take pleasure in writing however it just 
seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are wasted simply just trying 
to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions or tips? Kudos!
