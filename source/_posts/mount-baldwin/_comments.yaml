    Hello would you mind sharing which blog platform you're using?
I'm looking to start my own blog in the near future but I'm having a tough 
time choosing between BlogEngine/Wordpress/B2evolution and Drupal.
The reason I ask is because your design seems different 
then most blogs and I'm looking for something completely unique.
P.S Apologies for being off-topic but I had to ask!
