    Great post. Glad to hear you enjoyed SICP :) I've noticed this too, especially towards front-end as you say, also in general using "old" or "easy" tech like PHP or Python vs whatever FOTM deep neural network written in Rustlang on Kubernetnes or something. I see this a lot with vim/emacs too.

    It seems to me that it's relatively hard to gauge how "good" a software person so one identifier people use is various types of tech, especially those perceived as difficult to learn or abstract or niche. And then because no one can learn everything, most of these stereotypes are unfounded entirely.

    Possibly we're conflating "using difficult tech" with "being a good engineer"? Should we be asking people we meet, instead of what languages they know, what causes they're interested in or what they're trying to achieve with whatever tech they choose to use? I don't think this quite covers all the bases, some people like learning languages for the sake of learning them/the paradigm, but I think this could be a better way to learn about someone. Perhaps this doesn't really address your point of being respectful no matter what.

    Last thing that's slightly off-topic, have you been working on any cool new things in ClojureScript? I tried setting up figwheel a while ago but couldn't really figure it out...but reagent, garden, etc. look pretty cool, especially as a way to think about the DOM statelessly.

    I noticed this in inverse; ever since I went from doing Infrastructure and DevOps to Frontend FT, I've felt slightly embarrassed about the fact that I only write JavaScript now, even though I think it's a cool ecosystem with a thriving community.

Real porn videos happened in our lives in information, it complex the most workaday people who distinguish or do not grasp yon their licentious fame. If these indecent sexual acts took <a href=https://www.bemyhole.com/shemales_fuck_guys.new_videos/>kerrytmilf</a> hamlet at the partners' own request, then they specifically posed on the webcam. Straight into the lens, guys and girls showed how great they can fuck with each other, and go to not exclusively unflappable orgasms. No, lovers be undergoing also shown in which poses they choose to chum, quest of the benefit of orgasms. If the girls masturbated on their own, they wanted to captivate all the viewers.However, there is a odds that someone was austerely spied on and filmed someone's plebeian fuck or self-satisfaction on a covert camera. Instant this shooting has become handy to drochers, who resolve be hellishly on cloud nine to take care of how someone was involved in a hookup or allowed himself a depraved masturbation.
