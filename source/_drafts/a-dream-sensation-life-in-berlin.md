I can only go off the images and feelings because I can't even remember the names of things that make me sad to not have cached anymore. How can I forget the name of the part I lived next to and rode my bicycle through for months?

Feelings are more extreme in a place with more extreme season.

Everyone eventually comes to Berlin, many will eventualy leave. Malwine was telling me about Berlin syndrome where people who live there don't get too attached because they know their friends will eventualy leave.
